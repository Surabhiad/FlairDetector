Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

&#x200B;

One option you have - if OCI matters so much to you - is to tweet your problem directly to India's Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj. She is supposed to be proactive about such things, especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project a good (but false) image of our government, and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you. Also, pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the Indian way, and since you wish to become a quasi-citizen of India, you might as well start learning our bad habits.

&#x200B;

I, personally, am not a big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials. I wouldn't have gone for an OCI to begin with, and if I absolutely had to for some reason, I'd try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard. You have already sunk enough costs for a card that is of little benefit. I suggest dropping the idea entirely. As a Canadian, I don't think you'll have any trouble getting multiple entry tourist visa for frequent visits. This lady sounds full of shit. Why would an ambassador concern himself/herself with OCI affairs? 

Even if she isn’t lying, it’s worth emailing the consulate/embassy politely explaining the situation and cc-ing the ambassador if you can find their email. If there are multiple consular missions in the country, try emailing them as well. Tweet a summary with some details to Sushma Swaraj , she has helped ppl in similar situations Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through this.

As regards your OCI card application, tweet or send a message to the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj with your experience. probably you are lying in fine details, or it is shitpost or karma whoring.

as an official, one can certainly say that - an ambassador is too busy to deal with  ""We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds)"" r/iamverysmart individuals.

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record.","Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise."

5,AskIndia,"It all starts with the relationships we have with our families, the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions/reflections on life.  
Having a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward. India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory. Your position is too simplistic. It’s the kind of logic one would see on a meme. 

First of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‘freedom’ for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‘industriousness,’ the Chinese ‘stability and order’ and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. 

Nobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself — and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. 

Next, you don’t factor in how much of this ‘spirituality’ is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‘spiritualism’ is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. 

Where you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. 

Moreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It’s far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‘spirituality’ and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. 

And finally, is it all that ‘love and kindness’  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‘muslim countries’? 

Even regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‘swarms’ as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: “Where is the love?”

Your view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‘western’ countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here’s the thing: In my lifetime I’ve only seen it get better. 

I don’t even defend this characterization of India as a ‘spiritual’ place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It’s the foreign ‘Eat-Pray-Love’ crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that’s what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. 

Again, I don’t think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that’s just wrong.  Religion existed as means to control societies. It kept people within tribal groups. Gave them a code of behaviour and roles to play. It made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards. Plus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand. Now we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon. We follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals. We don't need religion really. Now it's only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life.  Spiritualism was once indeed an aspect of Indian culture. That generation is long gone. Today, spiritualism in the Indian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize (hey we might be losers, but we are ""spiritual""). In reality, we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some Western societies. Bc khaane ko paise nahi, rehne ko room nahi, peene ko daaru nahi, aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi. Aur tum sprituality ki baatan karte. Religious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound. Religious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic,sexist etc. these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not,what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not. If only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts,we wouldn't have so many problems in the first place  Communal politics.  Its an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking country-specific factors into account:

1) The West is economically developed vs India and has at least 30 years of a headstart. Any society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of.

2) No other country is as diverse as India - religion, language, food, culture, race, caste. You name it and India has it. Now I have nothing against diversity, but from a social perspective, it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development. Consequently, when there is no economic progress, social progress is hard to achieve.

3) You might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization, but there has been a real change in mindset, at least in the urban areas. This is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 20-30 years back. Even when you look at the USA, not every state has legalized gay marriage.

Btw, what is your definition of evil? The average middle class in India have always been like this. The spiritual India that you're talking about, existed in  ""Ramayan"" and ""Mahabharata"". I didn’t find what was the specific question though LOL, spiritual country my foot! Let me quote myself that I've written elsewhere, albeit bit edited. This was specific to issue of legalization of weed but, overall I think I got the point across.

",1543836135.0,1,36,0,39,"Hey, there's a term quite popular right now in news debate, of 'Gotra' and I don't know what it means, so can anyone tell me about it?
(Note: Actually I want to use 'AskIndia' flair also but couldn't do that as Reddit restricts flair to 1)",What is 'Gotra'?
6,AskIndia,"In Hindu culture, the term gotra (Sanskrit: गोत्र) is commonly considered to be equivalent to clan. It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or patriline. Generally the gotra forms an exogamous unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as incest.[1] The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes. Pāṇinidefines gotra for grammatical purposes as apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram (IV. 1. 162), which means ""the word gotra denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son."" When a person says ""I am Vipparla-gotra"", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.

According to the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad2.2.6, Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Kaśhyapa and Shandilya are seven sages (also known as saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called gotrâvayava.[2]

One who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is sapta-rishaye.

There exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises pravaras.

 Basically representing the ancestor.
e.g. Agrawals have 18 gotra based on the 18 son of Maharaj Agrasen.  Gotra basically tells you from which ancient sage your bloodline is descended from.

Gotra are very important to Brahmins. Other Hindu castes care lesser about it. Also you can use Gotra to tell from where a particular brahmin is from. That's how it was known Rahul Gandhi's gotra was from Kashmir.

Source: A Brahmin. There is agricultural metaphor behind gotra 'logic':

&#x200B;

*Indian farmers often draw  comparisons between agricultural and human reproductive  processes, as when they compare a fertile soil with a womb,  the seed with semen, sowing with copulation, harvesting with  the severance of birth and the happiness it brings, and  the barren lands with the post-partum period or, at times, with female widowhood. This reproductive view of agriculture is not unique to India, but is found elsewhere in human societies.*

>Men give the seed which encapsulates the potential child. A woman's body, like soil, provides the nurturant context for the foetus. This was graphically stated by another Turkish villager: If you plant wheat, you get wheat. If you plant barley, you get barley. It is the seed which determines the kind of plant which will grow, while the field nourishes the plant but does not determine the kind. The man gives the seed, and the woman is like the field (Meeker 1970: 157). The nurture that women provide-blood in the womb and milk at the breast-can be supplied by any woman. This nourishment swells the being of the seed-child and while it affects the growth and development of the child, it does not affect its essential identity; that comes from the father. Women's nurturing capacity is valued, but it must also be remarked that the substance they provide ultimately derives from men since men are thought to engender both males and females.  
>  
>

>The substance women contribute pertains only to this world-it is perishable and does not carry the eternal identity of a person. The child originates with the father, from his seed. This is the basis for what I call a 'monogenetic' theory of procreation.

But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.","What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?"
7,AskIndia,"You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.

Also, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close) I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place! I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.

First, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.
Indians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.
This explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.

Its definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.

The next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol) >My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. 

Quite likely. What snacks does their daughter come with? If it's a Western snack, then you can certainly bring it up with her parents. In India, it's considered quite rude to go to somebody's house and not eat at least a little of what they are offering you.

Having said that, you don't want to be pushy. The main thing is both your kids are building the friendship so just go with the flow.

The real issue is that they don't like Western food so even if you cook something special and bring it to them, they may be forced to accept it out of politeness but it would likely go to waste. They'll be more than happy to feed your child when she is over there so don't over-think it. They are probably happy their daughter has found somebody close-by she can be friends with. So, just relax and enjoy the friendship. I dont think that they dont enjoy western food.I think this is partially a cultural thing, part of being a good guest is to make sure your host isnt going to be troubled. Indians have this in common with Iranian people, it is considered polite to refuse the first couple of times, unless the host insists. If their daughter not eating the snacks you offer is troubling you, politely insist, they might usually take it after a couple of tries, or leave it out and let them help themselves. 

Eating sparingly is also considered good manners, rather than eating till fit to burst. Exchanging food and snacks is a common way of showing friendship. So taking food over to their house would be a nice gesture. I dont think you need to send your daughter with her own snack. I honestly don't know about why the neighbors daughter is bringing her own snacks and is not eating what you all offer. It is probably the things that others have said, that she prefers Indian snacks.

Regarding the neighbors eating sparingly when they're over at your place for dinner I have an alternate theory which might be true. often Indians eat dinner very late at night, maybe even after 10 p.m. if that is the case with your neighbors then if you offered them dinner at 7 p.m. they might just not be that hungry, and hence eating sparingly. You're overthinking this way too much. Cheeseburger next time plz It's a part of our culture (at least Bengali culture) to bring food when we visit any neighbour or relatives. I've seen it from a very young age and I'm used to with it. I think you are over thinking it. They won't mind.

  


I also have family in US (Houston, Texas) and they have told me that American food sucks so maybe that's why she doesn't like that. It's alright :) that moment of realisation that American food sucks really bad! ",1555598592.0,1,24,0,58,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks.

9,AskIndia,"Hate to break this to you buddy, but you are the third wheel.

The sooner you get out, the better it is for you.

I would suggest a show down as soon as it is possible. Ask her to talk to her parents and choose between you and her family asap. My guess is that she will choose the family. From what I gather her parents haven't even started pressuring her and she is already starting to break. Indian parents have a long list of arsenal at their disposal. Get your parents to meet her parents and fix the union.  [deleted] I've thought of doing this but haven't had to - Ask her to pretend to show interest in other women in front of her parents. And then eventually bring you into the picture. 

If there is anything Indian parents are more afraid of than inter caste marriage, it's homosexuality! 😁 Take the initiative. The kind of description you've given, I think this approach might work. Your girl clearly has no spine to stand up for you. Get her dad on your side, how, use money and respect. Address him as sir, be very respectable, go as far as promising to convert to whatever religion/cast he wants. Tell him you'll give her a good life. That could work, or at least will soften him.

Now man to man, I wouldn't advice going for a girl who can't stand up to her family, you may somehow marry her today, but her family will be a cause for grief all your life, because there will always be something with them.

Don't know all the details though, good luck! Welcome to casteism,OP. Try watching Bride and Prejudice for help. Same situation, except the girl told them that this is how she will love and that she will always love/respect/etc them, but she will choose the person she marries (me). Everyone also told me to 'forget it' and 'prepare for the worst', but she came through. All you can do is support her and make her aware of the tactics/ploys which her family will employ to psychologically browbeat her into submission. And by no means should you consider yourself any less. It'll be difficult at first but afterwards, you'll laugh about it.  In my experience, the only way these types of relationships work is if the Indian involved is strong enough to stand up for him/herself to their parents, ALONE.  In other words, ultimately the fight is between her and the parents - not you.  Even if you offer her all the support in the world, if she cannot in her heart fully commit to you and is inching closer to her parents' influence, then I don't think it is worth marrying her.  Think about it.  What if down the line, when you are long married, her parents keep interfering in her life and won't stop? And if you have kids, they will insist on raising them this/that way and may continue to haggle her over it. They will emotionally blackmail (Indian parents are unfortunately masters at this) until they get their way.  Point is, if she has problems drawing clear boundaries now, it will make your life HELLISH in the future.  No matter how strong a husband you think you are, a marriage is ultimately a two person deal and 'saving' her will only lead to heartbreak and psychologically scarred children.  Sorry to put it bluntly like that but I feel it's the truth.

The responsible thing, I think, is to really have her come clean on how strongly she wants to work things out with you, versus obey her parents.  Have an honest sit-down with her and push her into really answering objectively. If she is wishy-washy, tell her that you will have to leave her- because it shows that she is unwilling to face and meet the real consequences of her actions.  I know that relationships are rarely black and white in terms of how you feel for each other, and are often very gray - but real world consequences ARE black and white, with very real specific physical/mental/emotional results - that is why you have to get firm with her.  SHE is the one who will have to fight - and if keeping the family status-quo is more important to her, she won't have the strength to do so. 

No matter what happens, DON'T let your feelings for her propel you to 'save' her and be her champion.  It's almost sure to end badly for you, her, and everybody.  It may be painful to break up, but that pain will be nothing compared to what you will save yourself if you don't.  

So good luck, and remember- let it be up to her. There’s a reason you hardly ever see Indian women with non India guys.  
You just run smack into it. 

She’s just like the majority.

(Most) Indian women simply don’t do foreign guys be it tradition, family, culture.....

Unlike any other culture marriage in India  is an utterly unique, special, watershed event. I’m sure you know this thou. Are you sure that she's with you because she loves you or is she with you because, in a way, you're 'exotic' for her? Well I would suggest that you meet up with her family in some other pretext and get a sense about them. In many cases I have seen, Indian girls are way too scared to talk to their parents like mature adults and perceive things more severely. I would also suggest that you should ask her to identify a person close to her parents whom she can trust. That person can put in a good word to make things easier.
On a lighter note: Watch Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, it's a similar situation (to some extent). Understandably, she does not want to

Hurt her family's standings
Cause her family grief and pain
Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.... 


The ball is in her court. She needs to think independently and get this sorted. 

On the other hand,  I hope she loves you truly and not just because you're from a European country or for financial independence. You need to make this very clear. 

Please think twice before you proceed. 
Some Indian women are too emotional and tend to be escapist. 

Her parents would constantly belittle her for going  against them and this might  take a toll on your relationship in the near future. I'm also a  minor victim of this. 

 grandkids have fixed some of the relationships. your mileage may vary. Well I am late here. But all the best OP!

I hope your woman has the courage to stand up for you. 

In the end the family wants a genuine guy with a decent income and stable life ( I am sorry but that's how they work in India) and if they give you the chance to talk and you can convince them, there are possibilities. 

This would be a harsh test of her character and your patience, but I hope you guys come through. Please keep us updated  Move on and break up with her . Help info : where s her family located  ? What is her caste ? If she not willing to STAND UP TO HER PARENTS!!! LET IT GO

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here: 

https://www.amazon.in/Letters-My-Ex-Nikita-Singh-ebook/dp/B07938VDLS/ref=sr_1_2_twi_kin_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1535473766&sr=1-2&keywords=letters+to+my+ex

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair. ",1494854476.0,1,133,0,111,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.

13,AskIndia,">Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

It might if the people from your community are really hell bent on being orthodox & backward. 

>What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

These things are a state of mind according to me. If any family is economically secure then it should not give two cents about what people think or what people might say.  

My personal experience: I married a girl from lower caste community who is also my long time friend (both of us are Maharashtrians) My parents were cool about it but her parents were hell bent on breaking us apart & emotionally tortured my GF but she is amazingly strong & did not give up. There reasons were also the same as everyone gives, i.e. what will people say, we will not be able to face the community. Eventually her parents agreed for marriage(took 1 year to convince) & after 2 years I think her parents have slowly started to realize that it was right decision. 

At the end it is up to you if you want to go through the possible emotional atyachar of an inter caste marriage(which is obviously the great story to tell to your grand kids) or have a plain socially approved arranged marriage. I did intercaste adventurous (atleast to me) marriage. My wife is tambram and i am not. 
There will be problems and bitter feelings initially. 
Your first task should be to make babies (not joking here). That can settle down the dust. Also after you marry stay out of sight for some years.  Why? 
If you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous. 

Stand up for yourself. This is your life. Don't let some 500 year old tradition drive your life. 

Good luck! 

Edit: stay out of sight = go back to foreign country again?  > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

If arranged marriage, it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldn't want to get married into your family. But do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

This is a tough question. I can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence - do note that I live in urban area is south India.

It frankly depends on extended family. In the inter caste marriages I have seen, one girl's parents were boycotted by extended family for around 2-3 years. Petty snarky remarks in family functions, not attending wedding, avoid meeting etc. Her husband's family (except his mother) came around and rallied around the couple. In another couple I know, the guys parents are still pissed off (5 years now) but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged. His parents/extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs (like wearing mangalsutra), skin color etc.

So if your mom/dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and/or the extended family is their primary social circle, and the social circle is casteist, their ""prestige"" can take a beating. However, you are an adult and you have to live your decision. I can't answer this question. But you may want to put in a serious or reddiquette tag if you are serious about non-trolling answers.  If someone is rejecting your sister because you married outside your caste then she shouldn't be marrying the guy anyway.

Just my .02 rupee. Here is what i think , I think you are making a mistake. Leave her now.

Here is why?

If you wanted to be with that girl , absolutely none of the objections you have raised would matter. No one and i mean no one has a right on your future life. You and your partner have to be the only ones to decide. So even by asking the question and in the tone you have asked, i posit that you are not really into her.

Drop it now, not for the reasons you suggest but because you are not into her.


 Honor Killing is a possibility... They'll hack you and your wife into pieces and feed them to the ~~goats~~ gaus.. 

But seriously.. Fuck the orthodoxy.. If you want Indian society to progress you need to break away from useless traditions and mindsets which your family unfortunately still apparently follows.. 

Screw your parents.. (Not literally).. Your sister will be fine.. Its not like she's gonna be married the next day of your own marriage.. 

Chill..Marry...Repent..  Evaluate the fact if the girl is really the one. If the answer is yes, other things don't matter. 

Time heals everything and when your parents/relatives realize that you made a good choice they will reconsider their position.  Editing a few spelling mistakes. > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

Yes it will, Rajasthan in particular is a bitch about this. Both my sisters are Married out of community and trust me most of the family outright reject meeting my Dad because of this (I am not pushing for Marriage, my dad has no timepass so he is busy wasting his time on getting an arranged wedding done.). But the ones who do get ready fall into two bunch, one who are genuinely nice and progressive people and the second bunch who think this will be way of getting extra dowry from the brides family. So that's that. If you think you sister can find a or wants to find a partner on her own, then don't worry.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

Asshat from the community will bitch about it for the first few years, after that everyone shuts up once they find out how well the couple is doing. If you are confident you will end up in strong marriage with your GF then do go ahead and not let the Samaj bother you. If you are both outside India, then why don't you marry there. Nobody will really care in a few years. ",1467193873.0,1,14,0,9,"Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

Not sure if it's the same as your thinking, but here's an article about how farm loan waivers don't help in the long run. Helping everyone is the best way to get votes. We are studying foreign policy this sem. This is the point my teacher makes again and again. Indians are so busy with basic issues that the other issues including foreign policy are ignored. It is one of the reasons that the Indian foreign policy is so non aggressive. It is hard to distract the public with basics when there is a war going on. Compare that to that of the US where foreign policy is one of the issues of presidential debate. I know it's unrelated but we did it in class today and I just wanted to share.

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

21,AskIndia,"Are you good looking and bald ? 

Are you  6 feet ?

All you have to do three things first.

Lift

Lift 

And Lift more.  > being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties

For starters, please please don't let this be part of your sales pitch. 

>well settled for life in a secure job

This is more than enough. 

And don't worry about bald. Work with what you've got. Make that work for you. 
And as /u/immediate_cock mentioned, Lift, Lift and Lift more. i think you are not asking the right question to right people. i mean i doubt sehwag sir is a member here ?

i mean you have clearly demonstrated you are  person of means. quietly go for what sehwag sir did and regrow the silky smooth hairs on your balding patch. ( find a way to excuse yourselves from your GF )


BTW nobody knows what your girl thinks? maybe she is not really into your appearance only and may come to terms upon new knowledge about your balding head. 

so there are two ways given above. sehwag sir ki clinic ka address twitter DM me poochna, aajkal wo baato ke chakke marne me champion hai.  [deleted] > I am hopelessly in love with a girl  
    
No, you're not.  Balding like a girl? Is that in anyway different from balding like a guy? /s Tell her but don't take it to your head, you know, whatever she says. She's just another girl. Also the hair on your head has little to do with attractiveness. And you'll get over the ""feeling"".  

Cliched line, but since you are afraid of her rejection: Be a man.
 ""Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you""Matthew 7:7 what does settled for life mean?  >in a secure job

Elaborate

Theres nothing of the sort in the pvt sector. Are you in a govt job?  Go Heisenberg style.  Dude you sound defeated , chicks dig confidence . Shave your head , hit the gym and watch the panties drop . Your mileage may wary, I started balding in early 20s , shaved my head and had an active dating life . Now mid 30s , happily married . Confidence is the key not some filmi love  Saar, pliss to give me her number so that I can talk to her since you don't seem to be very interested. Talk to her for fucks sake or forget her. Worst thing you can do is hold on to her and waste precious time You're probably screwed. It hurts worse than anything, I know ;) 

- Alt a) If you got the stomach for it: Clean cut. Don't have her in your life. You'll miss her and it will hurt for a while. But the pain numbs after about 6 months, soon you'll move on. 

- Alt b) Remember: we most regret chances we never took. You say she knows you like her. Well, then you making a move will not surprise her; she might even like it (small chance). Ask her out, go have a few drinks, see what happens.  Dude if u think balding is a problem, then life has got some nasty surprises in store for you. You say you are well settled. Have you ever thought about the millions in this country who do not even have a proper meal everyday and are forced to sleep in open in this cold weather? I suppose not. Be thankful for what you have an don't whine like a child. If you are man enuff go and tell her, otherwise forget her and make s'thing good of your life. ",1481285503.0,1,42,0,8,"Hi, Randians. This is actually a throwaway account as my friends know me on reddit. As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.

**Second Edit**: Sorry if i came across as childish or immature. Truth be told, i was drunk when i made this post and perhaps it impacted my replying to some of the posts. Some of you have suggested  
to talk to her and not make assumptions about her. She is actually fully aware that i like her, and as one friend has rightly commented below that it is a case of one sided love. Perhaps talking to her is the only way to get out of this misery. I have decided to do this in the next week. My birthday is in Feb. and I pray to God that by that time i would be able to invite her to my b'day party. I will give an update, irrespective of the result.

22,AskIndia,"Even though your post is very long, the job you are thinking of switching to is not mentioned properly. Do you already have a company (to switch to) in mind or just going to join wherever you get? 

In my opinion, I would suggest you to NOT mention that 6-month work thing anywhere on record. Try to convey your thoughts about those 6 months in your interview. At the end, it's all about what they think about you in the interview. If they think that your 6 months was productive, it doesn't matter whether you have a document or not. Though I did not abscond, I had a couple of rough exits from some companies, I told it to Wipro, they called the company which I worked for and truth was twisted.... and I lost the job offer from Wipro, the HR in Wipro told me, better dont show it, because no company wants an employee with a bad history Just be honest and upfront. Why hide?. 

Say I worked there, had excellent training and learnt a lot. Unfortunately, my project did not give me enough intellectual challenge and did not fit well in my career roadmap. Hence, after evaluating few options and keeping my manager and team in confidence, I decided to move on and take opportunity that would make me happy.

Why complicate things?. If the company that you are targeting gets bothered by that approach, you need to ask yourself, do you really want to work for them. 

I don't think anyone will have time to really digg into what happened in those 6 months, rather they will spend time assessing if you are good enough for the job. And will you have clear free mind answering questions constructively instead of having something back of your mind like what if they find, what should I tell etc etc. ",1518008132.0,1,7,0,13,"So I came across this person on R4R.

I am planning to buy an apartment in Hafeezpet. The total amount is 47 lakhs for ~1100 Sqft near main road. Is this normal price? I am not so keen on buying but my parents in India are adamant about it. Rent expected is around 15000 + 1500 maintenance. Planning to take a loan for 30 Lakhs and use cash 20 Lakhs.

Edit: I don't know why I am getting downvoted :( I just asked a question with the AskIndia flair!","R4R missed connection. We interacted on R4R and we had a nice conversation going on, until a little misunderstanding came in the way"
24,AskIndia,"When you said “Parents in India” I am assuming you are abroad. Actually my parents also forced me to buy a house which was around 75 lakhs(chennai), but I didn’t . I don’t know about your age, income, risk appetite etc . Here is what I would do.

1) If I have 20 lakhs cash, bare minimum I would deposit in FD which would earn interest of 12,500/month. This is based on RBL bank interest rate.
2) I would then use 50% of this 12,500 every month to invest in stocks and 25% into mutual funds and keep the remaining as cash for rainy day.
3) if I have more risk appetite I would divide this 20 lakhs into multiple staggered buy for stock which I am currently studying. 
4) Rental income in India is not profitable plus you will pay EMI for probably 20 years which is again a burden on you.
5) there are beautiful EMI calculators online which will tell you how much you will end up paying for the 27 Lakhs for 20 years which is around 58 lakhs.

Is it worth it?? Meh....

This is just my thought...... Bro if you want to buy it because you and your parents need a place of your own to live and given that you can pay it off with the time you have left on your visa then it makes more sense. As much as I understand and appreciate  people living off a rented space because for them economically it makes sense. I would still suggest you to buy your own place it will give you peace of mind and moving every two - three year is not that fun on the top of everything intrusive flat owners.


   But if your sole aim is to save some money or create a new asset like this place as a future investment. Then I might suggested you should look for other investment opportunities, in that case atleast you will have a rough idea how much return you can expect off your money down the line.

Yeah and not just the subreddit.  For /r/india's 13000+ members ,very less number of people actually comment on posts or post anything .

My wild guess is ,people refrain from posting because as soon as you make a comment/post :

-Someone will oppose you just for the sake of it on the basis of million odd technicalities. 

-Some douche will start correcting your English.(Some kids relate your poor English skills with your opinion on that issue.)

-You might run into risk of hurting sensibilities of 'Seculars' or 'Hindutvas'. And ,then its all about jumping on conclusions to prove points.

-You might break one of those sub-reddit rules.

or

-You don't have anything to say or don't give a fuck about the issue.

On an average, on each post ,there are two redditors slugging it out over the most ridiculous things. 

Thats why /r/india resembles /r/worldnews . Its all about posting some news,then start bashing Indian society & how things are fucked up . Lekin agar woh bhi nahi kar sake, toh bring in Modi Vs. Gandhi debate,& you are good to go.

If we could just tone down our condescending attitudes,maybe more people will start contributing on /r/india.

However, I had to join a project within a month immediately after my joining. I joined a project with QA (manual testing) profile and worked there for 6 months. During that time, I realized that if I continue there, I wouldn't have too much growth into the future. I was also put into support work as well which means I was doing both testing and support work. I researched a lot, made up my mind and called it quits. I left using a medical reason and didn't go back to work.

After that, I joined a small company as a Jr. Java Developer as a fresher again and have been working there for 1.7 years. I have successfully transitioned from a testing profile to a developer one and gave one hell of a performance as well (as much as a fresher can give).

Now, I am thinking of a job-switch and I am confused as to whether include the 6 months spent at the previous company as work-experience or not? I don't have a relieving letter/experience letter from them. I do have an offer letter, joining confirmation and two random pay-slips from them. Do I put that experience in my resume and be honest to the next company about my past (this is what I am bending towards), or do I hide the experience and just show my current experience as the total experience? Moreover, If I decide to hide it, will it come up in a background check?

 ",1440164231.0,1,98,0,32,"#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki.

1. A self-post? Do you mean a comment?
2. Do you mean ""non-personal verified"" instead of ""non-personal and verified""?

> Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.

Isn't submission of unverified account anyway not allowed?

And so the only twitter accounts that are allowed for direct link submission are ""non-personal verified"" accounts like @PMOIndia, right? >Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.

In such a submission can the name of the twitter handle be mentioned in the title? Have seen a few such posts in the recent past. All of this is going to lead to  more controversies.  Ok, I almost never checkin here except when I do the odd RDD thread but I cannot believe this kind of policing is still happening!

What kind of a place has this turned into that it's making normal everyday indians who are more worried about the kujhli in their underpants to be this aggressive brand of assholes? Here we go again. More and more poorly thought out rules, imposed on the subreddit without any discussion. 

Indians are political and argumentative people. You mods cannot wish that away with your silly rules. Just let the sub be instead of trying to sanitize the discussions. 

This is a chai stall at a railway station, not a formal dinner in Victorian England.  Why is so much importance being given to political/religious threads? 

Why isn't the 'no low-effort' rule being applied to all the threads and posts? 

Man, either apply the rules uniformly or don't apply them at all and let us decide if something is high or low effort. I have seen the 'no low-effort' rule in other subs too but they apply it to everything. More subjective rules with loopholes as a pre-requisite and a necessary design criteria. 

Now, there is no way to differentiate between these two. 

1. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
2. Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.

So, basically, when our **subjective call** says that the user is ""*Flaming the forum*"", we can insta-ban the user. But, we can use yet another **subjective call** to claim that a different user was just indulging in Political humor. 

Just let this forum be. Why the fuck do we have religious threads This is how you make a Dead Sub. I've seen /r/india's rules worst so far. The twitter rules are fucking irritating.  >This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.

WTF. Why can't you guys just let the sub be as it is without adding new rules etc for even one month?

>Would be renamed to Policy. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government

I don't understand the need for a separate flair for this. Such discussions should be under Politics. [removed] Less objectivity, more subjectivity... I can already see numerous ways in which these rules can be twisted and interpreted to suit a person's personal biases.

>Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.

What criteria will be used to decide whether a comment is low-effort or not? Mods' subjective views?

>asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed.

Okay, so if supporters of a particular party bash another party based on a false report(as has happened so many times), and later on the truth gets posted, can we not ask where the bashers are now? Whats wrong with that? Nice. Also please try and do a full revision of the rules. Like all the rules at one place. Hallelujah!! Thanks for this! Are these rules going live along with post, or are you looking for building up opinion and then implememting it? 
 Agreed with the policy for political threads, but not religious threads. As rational people we should be allowed to ridicule religions. Not adherents, but the religion itself. 

If I wish to call Mohammad a paedophile, Yahweh a genocidal maniac or Indra a pussy-man, there shouldn't be a ban on it.  Could you sticky this, please? >accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions


WTF? Also, /r/IndianPeopleFacebook should be listed under related subs. 

/r/IndianFootball too. Oh, NSFW Indian subs too. Why the discrimination? What about genuine criticism of some aspect of a religion? For instance, me calling radhe maa human diarrhoea posing as a Hindu, rather than, say, calling Hinduism diarrhoea in religion form. So where exactly are you drawing the line? ",1437680297.0,1,33,0,51,"Dear subscribers,

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

This is quite a violation, no?

I'm sure you will say that if you want to critique, bring it up within /r/india and not outside?

Can we at least get some Indian mods? Someone who respects Indian sensibilities? Someone who understands, recognises and agrees with the democratic opinion of the country? 

Actually, I know the answer. Take it up your own modmail.

This clarification has been a long time coming. You should have given this clarification *before* banning people from the sub for it. Anyways, better late than never.

All good steps. I congratulate the mod team. Why has this thread been posted so late in the night?

Wouldn't the more logical thing be to post it during India hours when most active subscribers are awake? > Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will be holding elections in a few weeks.

So someone like hindusanghi123 will be the next mod now? > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.
 
Nope. It's become a lot more intolerant community which believes in violently criticizing groups of people or people in public but cannot take a personal insult when called to question on it. If you delight in shaming people you don't know from the comforts of your keyboard, it'd be hypocritic not to be ready to take insults in return.

> Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bullshit. So is the unverified twitter account rule.

The crappiest parochial thought fart someone ever had.

What's the problem with them? Bad titling?

Absolutely no point to this. Leave it to the user's intelligence.

Adding a question, why is **pure theology** as /u/rahulthewall puts it is **banned** in this subreddit? Isn't this also a sub where history is discussed. A verse of the Rig Veda was banned while an article talking about Hindu mythology in medium.com was allowed. Clarify your stand. If you're supporting banning it in the future, that's stupid.

The twitter flair is a nice idea BTW. score hiding will be awesome. good job mods!

ps. would never want to become mod. too much hardwork. you guys are good keep it up Can you put multiple flairs on the same post? i.e. if I post an article which is more than 6 months old about a political subject - what should I flair it as?

Bad.

Everything else sounds great.
 [deleted] Points are still visible on mobile or if you disable CSS, right?  Are you guys still taking the feedback? If yes then I suggest to NOT include AskIndia flair but instead redirect those to /r/AskIndia. Like /r/europe has on the top.

Also sometimes exact title rule doesn't really tell what is in the article. So for that something like *editorialized* flair should be there.

And now some queries - how much time should we wait for the mods to respond if the modmail is sent? Does *Repost removal policy* apply only to that article from one source or other sources too? Because different sources have difference in how the story is presented >About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.

You don't have to ban all links from these sites. Just the ones that have embedded YouTube/Vimeo videos. 

Also, could you guys have AutoMod notify us every time a comment that breaks the rule is deleted. I use c*unt a lot, and it seems to be a word that is monitored closely. Often I've noticed that my comments carrying the word get deleted even when used in a non-sexist or satirical context. I would like to know if/when any of my comments are deleted.

What about those cases in which no reply is received even after several reminders?

> please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. 

Again, you only pick and reply. The community should know if the mods are showing partisanship. 

> Is bringing up a user's posting history can be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

So basically I'm allowed to say one thing today and say something completely opposite tomorrow? > We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india[1] debate

What will be the criteria to select this shortlist? Thanks for the link flairs! That was required. 

Score hiding for an hour is good too. Please extend that to comment scores as well.

Also why 

> cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india




 Still zero feedback for why the mods seem terrified or simply unwilling to take any action against certain posters of a 'secular'/Leftist political bias with a habit of targeting others and the r/india community as a whole.

Are these posters mods or admins? Is that why they are completely immune and get a blank check to do whatever they like? Please clarify.  BTW mods, I'd appreciate if you applied the 'won't show downvotes' rule for new threads as well, because me and other posters identified as 'bhakts' or 'Sanghis' have been facing very furious and concerted downvote herding from r/india's 'secular' posters and lurkers. 

Every new thread I've posted in the last couple of weeks has been quickly downvoted to keep its score near 0 and usually certain posters keep topping that up every few minutes to ensure it never gets more than a few total votes and stays far off the front page.

 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. 

Manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development.

As far as UK is concerned, what period was the capacity weak & when did it become strong? I don't think India has an  unemployment problem It just has people who don't want to work.   ",1492834749.0,1,82,0,160,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

31,AskIndia,"Well, it has been a few years, since I have lived in India, while I was there however, I have patronized the services of EMS Speed Post on numerous occasions.

The chap behind the counter gives you a couple of forms to fill, one for the address, and the other for the customs declaration, and if you so wish, one for tracking the parcel or something....you then pay up, take your receipt and carry on on your merry way.

###Flairs

We promised to give you flairs, and we have not kept our promise. So, here goes. We suggest the following flairs (and if there are any that you want to see added, please suggest them)

* AskIndia
* Governance: To separate policy decisions from Political Posts

As mentioned above, please suggest new flairs that you would want to see. 

Now, let's address discussion in /r/India threads, especially political posts. A few ideas. **Do note that these are only ideas, we are not implementing them. We are only looking for your opinion**. 

###Political Posts

* No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.
* Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced. We want to implement this, but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this. 
* Remove low-effort political self-posts. 

### Non-political posts

* Same rule as politics for Twitter post (and other social media screenshots including memes). Specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a self-post. /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards. 

Please feel free to disagree with all the points made here. :)

33,AskIndia,"Could you improve wiki? Many times a post/comment is removed citing some non-existent rule. And you don't allow to make meta post about it. Which I can understand because you don't want drama. You ask to send mod mail. We send but then you don't reply to mod mails too. 

* Remove politics from this sub. Like /r/unitedkingdom has /r/ukpolitics, /r/canada has /r/CanadaPolitics, /r/australia has /r/AustralianPolitics etc remove political post and direct people to post in /r/indianpolitics. It will improve this sub.

* Make things transparent. /r/Futurology has /r/FuturologyModerators/ and /r/FuturologyRemovals/ where removed things are recorded WITH reason. /r/technology has has their automod configuration public /r/technology/wiki/automoderator. Use a meta sub to which allows easier communication and discussions. Case in point /r/metacanada 

* Add this post and other mod announcement posts in the /r/india wiki.  [deleted] >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

If I have to explain my meme or image in a self-post it is kind of counter intuitive, no? 

I mean, a picture is supposed to be worth a thousand words. My two bits:

* Remove the political post/politics altogether from this sub.

 our life is teeming with enough politics already be it newspaper or news channel with blaring mindless debates airing all day. And since many redditors have complained about the same in many self posts it seems like the right time to do so.
You can direct those who wants to discuss that to something like /r/indiapolitics if it exists or make one for them like many other countries sub did , if still you see people have this great uncontrolled urge to discuss which politician wrote what on twitter and those other shit you can always give them a warning first and if they don't comply then ban them from this sub(not shadowban,let them know why they are banned).

*  I'd suggest some flairs like **arts, sports and religion**. More flairs will keep different posts from getting mixed and people interested in a particular thing probably won't downvote the stuff they are not interested in and new genuine posts in their respective category will hopefully get a breathe of upvote from interested people. +1 for no political twitter spam > Remove low-effort political self-posts

Please elaborate on this?

Also, you guys to need to ensure greater transparency in your process. >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

I don't think this serves any purpose at all. The reason these memes and tweet links exist is not for OPs to score cool karma points, but to reinforce his/her own political views. So self post or not, these low effort posts would continue to clutter the feed. 

>Remove low-effort political self-posts.

You will need to elaborate on this or else you are going to get accused of muzzling opinions.  Since there is an announcement, I want to bring up couple of points which affects the quality of discussion here.  These are tangentially related.             
Does this sub have an official stand or voice on any issue? Is it a place for discussion only or reddit India supported activism?  For example Net neutrality debate. I think the official voice of redditindia should not get into activism irl. It encourages brigading and suppressing contrary voices.          
I think it was wrong that redditindia took an official position on contentious issue like NN which lead to brigading in real life.  Shouldn't have happened.            
Second, do we need the twitter account of redditindia to tweet hot posts? And is there a criteria. I  have seen low effort self posts getting tweeted. I  see that as an encouragement. 
 Ooh.. common account as a mod.. 

*interesting*

Governance flair sounds good. Hopefully we'll have more discussions on that.
 How about a flair to seperate the faking news/unreal times articles from the real news. > Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Yes and yes. >but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this.

Any other conditions? Wheeee flairs!!   
TIL, LPT/jugaad, ELI 5, ITAP, TOMT, throwback for old awesome posts that newcomers can enjoy like out of loop.     

But can we also have something against down voting self posts into oblivion?     
 [removed] You people tried to moderate political thread last time as well it didn't work. Politics is the major subject on this sub and unless you double the moderators keeping political posts strictly r enforced will be hard.  [removed] Having to explain memes kind of spoil the fun. And that also kind of deters the content makes (Who am I kidding, no randian makes original content). Even then, atleast its possible in the future. Aand thats how you make a dead sub...btw instead of these useless flairs why not make a ""Delhi"" flair to filter it out all the useless AAP posts. I have a moderation related questions.   

When Moderators delete a post, I have seen 3 kinds of things happening.

1. A comment is posted to the thread about why it was deleted   
2. A [deleted] message appear on the self post    
3. Sometimes neither of the 2 happen, but the post still disappears.    

So what's the difference? Why not a message in the thread any time a post is deleted by moderation?   
 Add a flair for geopolitics.  AskIndia is good but I don't think Governance flair would be used often. Rather, have a Weekly flair for regular posts. Another suggestion, have a BJP/AAP/Congress flair along with Political. A lot of people want to read political news not related to these 3 parties.  Rules rules and more rules....At this rate One day you will have to delete all political posts and move it r/IndianPolitics  > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. 

no direct submission to posts made by verified twitter handles makes no sense. make this rule about unverified twitter handles.

verified twitter handles serve as news source, and you have policy of not editing the news headlines, but you want users to editorialize  the 140 character twitter posts. That defeats the purpose of twitter, as a platform.

 Please could you add a crime flair. We get quite a few of those posts, and one for the counselling needed type relationship posts.

How do you define low-effort political self posts? Also what about low-effort political comments in political posts? Can you guys have the automod say which words are censored from the sub so that when my comments get deleted I can remove the offensive words? Thx Mods can you bring back the weekly movies thread

They were being done earlier but then were disbanded dues to lack of popularity after some time

Now with the whole make /r/india better thing going on

I think it would be good time to bring them back, and see how they work now

Plus it would also increase semi-Original Content and NP posts

Maybe stickie those threads early on Whenever we have one of these posts, it is followed by another list of new rules. Can we just let things be for a while?  Please bring up new ways to help new redditers  [deleted] IMHO, you guys need to cut down on your stupid rules, instead of making shitty new ones. 

You guys remind me of the following story:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_miller,_his_son_and_the_donkey I can pitch in as mod and help out if you guys are okay with that. 

Edit: just saw the comment by the mods regarding signing up. Will modmail.  - Regarding ""no direct submission to images"" for [P] posts, could you please clarify the reasoning behind this idea? Doing away with memes and ""caption this"" makes sense, but why all images? For example, would an image of a politician slapping someone not be relevant content which would not require any further explanation? Additionally, if you do decide to go ahead with it, why just images and not audio/video?

- Could you clarify what a ""low-effort"" political self-post would be? Would all such content need to be backed up by data or are opinion pieces also allowed? If data is to be made mandatory, how would you plan to make sure that the content isn't an op piece with some data just for the sake of sticking to the rules? [deleted] ""Governance"" flair is an interesting idea. Not sure how much traction it will get but it's worth a shot. There is a very urgent need to separate political bullshit and rhetoric from actual impactful decisions that political parties are taking.  I am very against these ideas of writing essay for self posts. I have already expressed my opinion [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3d8epc/is_noise_drowning_out_the_signal_in_rindia/ct2to3p):

> and low-effort content is always upvoted to the top

subjective. people upvote what they like

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.
> 
> No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.

it's censorship. mods shouldn't decide what is 'low-effort' and what is not. the members of community should.

and not everyone wants to read a essay about why submitted an image of some tweet. 

>  /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards.

People like it. Let them decide what they want by uproots/downvotes.

 We need more flairs. Arts, Movies, Books, TV, etc etc. 

We need weekly threads for different topics. Can we automate this please?  Be more strict with with titles which are unverified and misleading. I see them not tagged Wrt flairs.

Try and choose a flair which is a unique set with minimal Overlap and a topic obvious from the name.

So for example governance could be policy. Entertainment I think would be too broad.

Sports is a good choice. I think DIY maybe of value. Ask is another option.  Please take care of posts which are low effort under political flair. Don't let them shitpost. For example like today 

Really low effort & shit post

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlxn8/proof_that_rss_is_literally_hitler/

One line statements from Twitter which creates cicrle-jerk

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlo0y/tell_narendramodi_to_remove_his_paramilitary_from/

Rather ask such people to make self posts or wait till any media house writes a full article on this. What is the point in creating multiple threads due to just one comment from any politician?

As we are growing, we are lacking space on the front page, news & politics keep on clogging up that space.

Please don't resent anything & be harsh on these assholes. You have my vote on this.

Please bring more flairs other than AskIndia/HelpIndia like Sports & Entertainment. Please have more weekly threads like those tech threads & also sticky those threads so more people comment. Thanks for taking the initiative, the new flairs sound like a good idea, implementing them, a far bigger proposition, but doable!!    
>Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced         

This needs to be done. I know it is a big task for the mods, but its the need of the hour! You can find people who are actually driven to do this, and if implemented,along with removal of low effort self posts, will be a welcome respite, and greatly improve the quality of political discourse in the sub.    

Again thanks for trying to bring about a change and I wish you guys all the luck to go through with it. you'll need it :) Could we limit the posts with personal questions and rants? They're almost always unverified, troll bait and conform to the subs circlejerks.

I'd love to see more moderation of those posts than deleting ""Chaddis vs AAPtards"" kind of comments. The latter get downvoted pretty often, anyway. Could you post some guidelines about downvoting that people will see more prominently when they are about to downvote?

Right now whenever someone sees something they don't agree with, it is downvoted to oblivion and it fosters a kind of circlejerk where you only see the majority opinion and anything that disagrees just disappears.

Other options might include keeping the threads in contest mode for a longer time. I used to avoid /r/India like the plague, but now I'm starting to see a lot of intriguing discussions. I still disagree with some people, but we are able to discuss in a logical and informed manner, as opposed to the childish, irrational, and chauvinist way people were a while back.

Re-subscribed. 1. Strictly objective rules. Remove all subjective interpretation from rules. This continues the situation of ""we have fallen short"" remark. When there is no objectivity, two people can have a different opinion about the same comment, and then a rule ceases to be a rule and becomes an opinion. 
2. Self posts for images. Well, there is already a work-around and loophole in current rules where users can post a collage of more than one twitter screenshot and not use exact title rule. Self post provides an easier editorializing of the title. Exactly how will this help reducing shitpost is unclear to me. 
3. New common account that is purely for communication. Does this mean you are now willing to discuss controversial mod decisions in public? This will help the community to understand the thought that went behind deleting some comment or thread and what was the subjective reasoning used? Unless subjective decisions are discussed and debated, these rules are just anchors of imposing your opinion on mod activities. Any comment can be constructed to violate any random rule because ""I felt so"" without any accountability to the community! Modmail is just a safety net because you are afraid that you may have been wrong and 15 people collectively pouncing on one person is better that 300+ people pouncing on the mods for a wrong decision.  Media,Random,Other.


I guess these will be cool flairs. [deleted] Good points...personally, am in complete agreement  *AskIndia*   *Governance*  what do this flairs even mean? 

And how am I suppose to make a self post on a meme in NP category? Defeats the purpose of Memes doesn't it? Thought this place would be more open and free. Definitely need a Political sub and also rules 'only where needed'.  [deleted] >Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Who is going to decide this ?
As it is, there is already too much censorship in a so called platform for free speech. Request:Can politics/religion related posts (I put those two because they are closely linked) be moved to /r/IndiaPolitics or /r/IndianPolitics or whatever that sub is? Would be nice to have more music related posts. Especially folk music from different parts of the country. Please ban twitter and facebook from unverified accounts altogether. Even the ""screenshot+blur"" thing is ridiculous. Self posts with an actual argument that quotes statements from known but unverified officials (i.e. legit public figures who don't have the mark of verification) should be allowed. >Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

And yet you have trolls calling the PM a faggot. How about a [Health] or [Medicine] flair as well? Indians can do with some evidence based medicine. > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.   

I agree with twitter restriction and most of twitter posts are again self-posts without any explanation behind them^Swamy. But, memes keeps the sub interesting. Some of the memes are shit, but I have seen some amusing ones that are randian's creativity.

This video does an amazing job of explaining the problem with fpps. 

There are several alternatives to it, some are linked in that video itself.

Fpps is considered to be one of the worst system of elections and you can trace many of our problems to it. 

Edit: some of the alternatives are alternate vote and single transferable vote.  Fpps is the system in which the candidate with the most number of votes wins, regardless of the number of votes. 
For eg, there are 9 candidates in an election. One gets 12% and each of the others get 11%. The one with 12%will win the election since he has the highest number of votes despite his share being very low. 

This was the system followed in Britain at the time of Indian independence. That and the simplicity of the system led the makers of the Constitution to adopt it.

If you consider swiss uni. like ETHZ , they also ask for course material you referred so that you meet the academic standards/background they expect. I assume it's something similar in Germany. US universities generally accept any 4 year course if you want to apply for MS/MS+Phd. They look at your academic record and GRE scores.

Getting into top-end universities is extremely hard though and there is a lot of competition from all over the world. If you want full scholarship (this is usually given to MS+PhD students) the competition is just insane for places like MIT/Stanford.

I'm not 100% sure about Germany but the UK accepts Indian 3 year undergraduate programs (except medicine, you need to sit for PLAB). I'd imagine germany is similar to UK.

42,AskIndia,"All MLM are scams Long answer: yes

Short answer: ya Yes it's a scam but has managed to survive despite intense scrutiny. There's a great documentary about Herbalife on Netflix 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-jrALajXrI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-jrALajXrI)

&#x200B;

Bill Ackman had a billon dollar short on Herbalife and tried really hard to take them down - tried. Post this in r/MLM too It's name is so MLM. Get away from your friends who are pushing these schemes onto you. If you care about them tell them these MLM will rob them off their money as well as friendships. Yes, so is Amway and others. Don't go for it unless you are very sure of being able to find other bakras who can register under you so that you can get commission from their sales. It works for few, a colleague had quit his job and earns good money via mlm, but many others have lost their money,time and friends. Even health-wise, it's no better than cheaper substitutes. If you are only drinking protein drink and not eating anything else, you will lose weight without Herbalife. Just that people tend to stick to diet only when they paid lots of money. There was a big thing with investors bill ackman and Carl icahn where Bill show that herbalife was a scam but lost money anyway coz the company was profitable even though it is evil.

So no. Try to help your friends but ultimately distance yourself from them. And save all the communications you have with them in case they accuse you of stealing their money. Prevention is better than cure. /r/antimlm Stay away from Herbalife. Complete scum.

https://youtu.be/s6MwGeOm8iI Yes it is a scam . Check out r/antimlm too. it's a big scam, a Ponzi scheme and every other antimlm term you can find on the internet.       
They front as a healthy life business, but it's not. it's just to pull you in and trap you.            
and I call it a trap because that's how people even get interested in all this, it all seems very attractive and life changing even, but it'll take your life down hard.        
also watch John Oliver's take on MLM's when you get time. Ok, so there are dozens of people giving you the correct answer that yes, it’s a scam. I don’t need to be the 101th person to tell you, but in case I do, YES, it’s a huge scam. 

It works like this. There’s one person at the top whose survival depends on recruiting people below him. They’ll buy his shit, and then they’ll try to recruit people under them to sell their shit too while telling them that they’ll be their own boss and can make however much they want. Yes, that’s true, you decide how much you make by getting as many people to join below you (which is exactly what your friends are trying to do to you - their survival depends on it). The moment you are unable to recruit people below you, you’re stuck with a bunch of inventory and little cash. 

If your friends aren’t able to see it and you’ve done everything you could to explain to them, then I seriously recommend getting smarter friends. Please don’t take it as an insult, but as my sincere advise.... Products might not be scam. Two of my friends have tried Herbalife and reduced a lot of weight. That might have happened as a result of their rigorous exercise schedule, for all I know.

Water and environment might have some passing effect, but if it's in your genes, consider yourself fucked out of a full lush head of hair. 

Makes me cry everytime. Bangalore can make you go bald due to the ground water that some parts of the city uses. Check for water quality. Hard water does that. Check water quality. Hard water can make your hair brittle There are so many reasons for balding:

Genetic

Hormonal

Hard water

Autoimmune 

Last but the best, EVOLUTION (You don't need them to survive so if you're balding and all the other causes are ruled out then consider yourself to be on the forefront of evolution). It's an advantage. Avoid stress, keep your scalp always clean- no dandruff and shit. This worked for me. So, after moving to Bangalore, my hair started turning grey. Moved back home and the grey is almost gone now. Genetics are the main reason for early balding. Your maternal grandfather's hair is a generally a good indicator for your hair health. If he faced balding problems early in his life, there is a good chance of you facing them too.
Stress, diet, haircare and exercise definitely help but if your genetics are the cause of your balding, you're going to face a tough time dealing with it. 
Consult a trichologist who'll give you better insights about it. All I can say mate is go buzz. It's due to genes. But still there may be chances that it's temporary.

44,AskIndia,"I've trained for 5.5 years in NCR, hopping gyms every 6-12 months. I've been to some cheap gyms (INR 800/month) and been to some relatively expensive chains (bomiso, anytime fitness) and one thing is pretty common - the trainers all suck.   


In fact, in my experience, the most knowledgeable gym trainer I've met was at the cheapest gym - he owned the gym, and was running it in the basement of an actual residence.   


Here's how I've learnt to deal with the pseudo-trainers:   
1. Make them know their place: They're there to help you *if and only if you ask for help.* You've paid for the membership, which means you can use the equipment. You're under no obligation to listen to 'trainers'.   
2. Be courteous, but distant with them. Say ""I have my routine, I'm doing this."" Many trainers will just leave you alone, thinking you already have another plan, or know more than them (which is actually very probable)  
3. Follow your routine to a T, so you can impress the same guys with your results, in silence.   


Best of luck! I've been going gym since 2008 and have trained quite a lot of people for free, I can confirm that majority of trainers don't even know the names and proper form of exercise. Let alone talking about compound and isolation exercises. Gyms don't have a degree requirement so every gym bro or even a newbie can apply to become a trainer and then keep fucking up everyone else body. That's just exercise. Most of the people don't even know about nutrition and stuff. They will just point you to the nearest supplement counter. The deadlift one is actually correct. It's called a mixed grip, it improves stability and prevents the barbell from slipping. You need to alternate your underhand and overhand when using mixed grip so that you don't develop muscle imbalance. I got lucky when I started going to gym where there was a trainer in his 40s who knew almost everything there is about fitness that was in 2010. And now in Bangalore these trainers literally doesn't even know to teach pushups in correct form. Be careful when you choose to join a gym. Any should or knee joint issues will affect you throughout your life. ""It's damn hot, can you turn on the AC?""  

""It's good if it's hot, you'll sweat more so become thinner.""  

WTF.png Dude ,I have been lifting for 3 years and have even helped my friends in transformation,till now I have not seen a single trainer or even a competitor who knows his shit. I have even trained with Mr.UP and he doesn't know shit about training. These people are complete jackass . Most of these guys use PEDs told to them by some trainer and then suffer. You can check tarun Gill's channel on YouTube and not even 1 competitor knew his shit,1 of them was telling to stop bathing before competition. [deleted] I've been to 3 gyms in Bangalore including cult fitness and yes the trainers don't know shit. I would have got tendinitis if I continues with the cult fitness class. To be honest most of our workforce except the creamy layer need to be trained and retrained. This is the pain which comes with a growing nation. For instance, try looking for a handyman who is competent. It's really hard, or they are already working for a big company. The money they get from the jobs is also not so high so they don't put their heart and soul into this so they can make things better. Hopefully with growth of economy our country's workforce skills also grow up I used to go to a gym for a while (2014-15) and one of the trainers straight up told me to take some steroids cause I'm too skinny. Optimum nutrition



😂😂 True that. 

A lot of trainers focus on unnecessary things or sound phony asf. 

From what I've seen, Cult seems to carry some good trainers with good certifications.

Most of all, all the trainers that I've visited or seen are self made, they built a good body and then became a trainer because of the money. 
So they don't exactly know the scientific way but the way that worked for them. 

Either way, I see most Indians go through a lot of YouTube channels and blogs and pick what suits them best. 

My buffy buddies are all from the same method. I have gone to some form of gym for the past 4-5 years. For 2 years, when I went to the normal gym, I was doing squats wrong and no one told me about this (I dont know if it is because they didnt know or because of not giving a fuck since they are underpaid).  And many of them focus on isolation exercises and not compound or functional exercises which is a huge problem. 

I went to a functional fitness (not crossfit but similar) gym 3 years ago and that is where I came to know about Squats, Deadlift etc. But here too, the main trainer knows his stuff well while others do not. 

These trainers are also trying to sell either protein powder or dietician none of which I wanted. This is because they are earning about 15-25k per month (which is quite less for the amount of hours they put in tbh). These trainers make their money from personal training and hence maybe the lack of interest that you see around. 

Another important thing that all gyms across the country lack is their ignorance of cooldown. Most gyms do not focus on cooldown while those that do, do not spend more than 10 mins. I learnt it the hard way by going to the physiotherapist and spending 5k for rehabilitation. 

Currently, I go to the gym in my building itself. the trainer there is good, but doesnt know enough compound exercises. 

IMO, if you are looking at only fitness and have no huge goals, you can workout at home itself because there are a lot of online channels posting workout videos. All you need is a pair of dumbells  and a mat. Have been lifting for over 6 years, this should come as no surprise to you, there’s no regulation. 

Unfortunately you’re going to have to do your own homework on the internet and use your head to navigate the bro-science. 

While I lived in bombay I used to go to Nitrro, the membership was quite steep but the trainers knew their stuff there. But for the most part elsewhere, for sure, clueless. Certified trainers anywhere in the world will cost a fortune!

I have been working out for a long time without a trainer, using my own routine and have had fairly good results.

I recommend sites such as scoobys workshop (funny name but totally worth it) and the forums of bodybuilding dot com. The thing to keep in mind is that it takes time to build muscle and get sustainable results. There is no quick solution and any person giving quick results is either a liar or will end up hurting you. Yes. As with all fields in India which are technical.

If any of you want to learn to lift or whatever, just go to [https://startingstrength.com/](https://startingstrength.com/) Welcome bro. I use Jim wendlers routine which you can find online or buy his book. And use my trainer mostly as a spotter so that I don’t go bad form and break my back. I think that’s the best way to use Indian trainers and yes creating a routine and dieting wise they all suck according to me. This really depends on the franchise gym you go to. 

&#x200B;

Background : I used to go to Gold's gym in Chennai (think it was the first branch they opened in the country) and the trainers were all top notch. Even in Maverick's (FLUX now, I think) the trainers knew what they were talking about, and a good proportion of them were looking to get further certifications in the fitness industry. 

&#x200B;

I suppose it's a pretty banal case of you get what you pay for. The fitness industry, like a host of other industries, that have arrived in India needs some time to mature I suppose. The bonus isn't that bad. Pros usually deadlift with a mixed grip, it prevents the bar from slipping too much when compared to a double overhand grip. That's because when the bar starts to roll out of one hand, it rolls **into** the other.

Here are things the trainer at my gym said (I don't pay him, he's the owner too):

1. Heavy weights build size and no strength.
2. Do light weights with 25+ reps for fat loss.
3. Lat exercises reduce love handles
4. Side bends reduce love handles

People I know have had it worse than me. Their trainer made them do all machine workouts the first day, and full body workout every day for a month or so. And they went to posh gyms!

So yes, Indian trainers are pretty bad. Mainly because we don't have the level of education here which is possessed, or required to be possessed, by someone of that nature. Most here follow broscience of ""shock the muscle"". The trainer at my gym doesn't even know what Starting Strength and 5/3/1 are! Warming up has a lot of different connotations.

Warming up with lighter weights to practice form before the lifts? That's good.

Warming up by running on the treadmill for 10 minutes then practicing judo kicks for the next 10 before you actually pick up weights? Not productive. How to detect a bad trainer : Ask his opinion on leg curls and upright rows. If he approves of either of these, he's a bad trainer. Depends

I have been going to Gold Gym for last 4 years, and the one I train under is great

But it sucks for the wallet The body shape of most gym trainers in India says everything it has to about untrained gym trainers in India. Gym trainers in India are basically people who have spent a shit load of time in or around gyms I have seen quite a few trainers who don't know much but have somehow built a good physique, but there are also others I have met who REALLY know their shit as well as the science behind building muscles, something like the Athlean X guy. I'm never gonna forget the way one of them described chest exercises to me, the way they're supposed to be done...what people do wrong etc. Unfortunately that person rarely offers personal training and owns the gym lol Does anyone here know how good the cult.fit classes are? Especially the boxing classes? > Deadlifts? One palm grips front, one grips reverse. Haan, jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho"".

I have seen guys do that. what's the logic of doing that? I have foudn vice versa also, many people are not even willing to listen to sound advice, since sound advice requires working on form and technique. People in my gym do half squats without wanting to put in effort to master below parallel depth. Some do close grip bench with very close grip, fuck wrists. Lift arms all the up top in dumbbell rows. And despite my reasoning (some of these are friends), most just stay on, since they can lift heavier weights this way with poor form. People however flock to model/trainer in my gym who looks better than me :/. I dont know where you live but i live in vasai and in my local gym there are certified trainers. I have been training for more than 7 years . Most of the trainers  who are certified are always looking for clients because they earn more throught clients than spending more amount of time being employed inthe gym. My advice is do your research. If you are willing to invest time and money in the gym you should invest some time in picking up a routine and progressively overload. Most trainers suck. They offer diet advice even when they know they are not supposed to. They don't understand that rep range depends upon fitness and advice 15 reps to everyone.the good thing is I've met some good trainers. They don't try to force their methods on everyone. I lucked out way back in the day and ended up with a high level powerlifter as a trainer. He was into heavy lifts, low reps and a LOT of rest in between sets. 

I lucked out in joining the gym. It was cheap, great equipment, empty most of the time so the trainer had nothing else to do but chat with me and give fitness tips. Wow, a lot going on here. I have been trying to get fit and get regular at a gym but I don't know what should I do. I am not experienced with the equipment and gym instructors only help out in the initial few days of joining a gym. Any ideas where I can learn the movements and how to do them safely, I'd like to avoid injury at all costs.  I have tried watching tutorials on youtube but it there is too much noise there to make senseful plan. Gymming veterans please help guide me. > BONUS: ""Deadlifts? One palm grips front, one grips reverse. Haan, jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho"".

This one is correct advice, but you don't need to do this for lower weights. As you stack more weights, the chance of slipping goes up. Also, when you lift the plates can spin a little because both your wrists are facing the same direction. The momentum can be enough to cause the barbell to spin out from your hand. 

TBH, i've seen lot of bro-sciency stuff even in the west. Trainers who keep updating their knowledge are the best ones. Ones who haven't will tell you it's ok to do lat pull downs behind your neck like they used to 20 years ago. Anytime fitness here pays general trainers like 10k for 8 hours shifts. A good occasionally competing trainer eats 30-40k  a month.  Senior trainers are also some 3-6 months certified ones with 2-3 years of lifting experience.

&#x200B;

But this thing is fading with the ecoms and these new Indian youtubers like Jeet Salal, Gaurav Taneja, Mybollywood Body, Guru mann, Sangram Chougule, Sahil Khan etc. So these trainers nowadays are mainly just for spotting weights or running an illegal steroid cycle. What gyms have you heard these from? Supporter nhi phnega toh ""chhota"" ho jayega "" paani bhar jayega"" I have learned the proper forms, techniques and workouts from YouTube. Yup they are. They also practice the worst bro science and will just take juice to get their body.

I've been to only one trainer at a local gym for nearly two years and he has been pretty decent and haven't heard any of this shit. Only thing is for deadlift he advises to use mixed grip as it gives better grip/stability. Ur right. Thats the case with 90 percent of the trainers. These guys are filled with bro science and have at some point in their life and/or currently taken steroids, to get their body where it is now. 

These idiots also peddle steroids / growth hormones / growth hormone releasing peptides to young naive gym goers to help reach the ideal 'instagrammable' physique. 


Off late these dumb fuck trainers have discovered muscle building content on youtube via fake natties and sellouts, further fuelled with social media and popular forums and are again peddling misinformation and bad plans to people.  There seems to be no end to this chutiyapa. 

People need to have thier eyes opened to the right information. Yes [deleted] [deleted] Darebee.com for routines and freeweight exercises This is very true One guy who used to train in our gym for a few years off and on has now become a trainer for a reputed gym brand (I won't say the name as I don't want him to get in trouble). Apart from the fact that he weighs barely more than a feather, we know that he doesn't know a thing about exercises, let alone nutrition and stuff. So, yeah, that's bound to happen. Also, most of them force you to increase the weight, without asking you to do so progressively, infact they don't even care about form, which is really important Ratio of gym patrons with fit bodies to unfit bodies is surprisingly high at my gym. I'd think the trainers do a good job here. Why would you call yourself a bad trainer? I started training in 2014 and have been training for the better part of last 5 years in Hyderabad. I have been to multiple gyms from cheap to the expensive ones(Core fitness). In my experience most of the gym trainers that i have met and conversed with don't know anything about training and bodybuilding. Most of trainers that i have encountered are just a bunch of guys who trained for a few years using PED's and steroids being completely clueless about basics of training, supplementation and  nutrition. Infact, most of them are just there to sell you products like protein powders, BCAA's, Creatine and that too fake ones. Even most of the youtubers present in Indian bodybuilding community like Rohit Khatri, Tarun Gill etc do not provide science based empirical studies and evidence behind their exercises and videos and is just bro science. I personally find youtubers like Seth Feroce([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkZuCxXdE6OUGDEbETcjhPw)) and  Jeff Nipard([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/icecream4PRs))  the best in the industry when it comes to sharing knowledge relating to supplements, exercises, importance of warmups, gear amongst other things.

Some Cons that aren't always shared:
Expect a much quieter social life, a cultural gap in addition to a generational gap with your children, a reduced sense of self-identity, a lower standard of living and immense adjustment stress. 

Ofcourse you'll have more money after immigrating but it won't feel as luxurious as it sounds when one multiples dollars into rupees. If you enjoy a more self-involved lifestyle, it'll be easier to adjust. If you'd like, I'd be happy to chat over dm and answer more specific questions. I my opinion if you are looking for material happiness then immigrating is not a bad idea. What I mean by that? With just two months of salary in Canada you can actually afford a nice 60 inch LED TV, a sound bar and a nice couch. One year into job you can afford a muscle car like Camaro or Mustang (with loan ofcourse). You can also meet Indians and make new Indian friends by going to temples or other Indian group meeting that you look up on Facebook. 

But if you are a kind of guy who likes to be around family and friends, don't really care what car you are driving and the kind of house you are staying in then Canada might be boring. All in all I would say getting Luxury is easier in Canada/Australia than in India. But getting Family and friends is easier in India. And as someone already mentioned if you have Kids then the equation is entirely different. I migrated to Canada in 2017 - it's been a great experience for me so far, but it boils down to effort, luck and circumstances. 

My standard of life by local comparisons is definitely lower than my peers - a dollar goes a lot less than a rupee would in India. Having said that, though - I've never been a particularly money obsessed person. Give me a cot, 3 square meals and a roof over my head and I'm good, but I do appreciate that the quality of stuff I get here is substantially better for the amount I pay for it compared to India. 

Professional growth - I'd argue it's the opposite due to my specific circumstances. Employers let you Work from Home, some others (like mine) have an 'education allowance' to allow you to upskill on the company's dime, I get plenty of days off (5 day work week, statutory holidays means no work - it's actually straight up criminal and I get Christmas week (till New Year's off). Nobody questions/interrogates you if you want to take a few days off. I actually changed my role within the company because my own manager said I'd be a right fit for it and he helped me get the job. I love my coworkers and we get along very well. 

Racism - Can't speak for Australia but in Canada, it's mostly been low-key and barely noticeable if not non-existent (largely owing to the significant number of Indians already in Canada), outside of some clearly mentally ill people (the city of Toronto does a shitty job of looking after the mentally ill homeless people, especially now that it's summer and they're all around the city). 

I've already accepted the fact that neither side will truly accept me for what I am (Third Culture Kid, so not really fully Indian and not really super westernized, either) so the idea of a generational gap is already a forgone conclusion. 

Happy to answer any questions if folks are interested in learning more about the process or are generally just weighing options and want to know more about life in Canada - I also happen to run a landing group for new immigrants basically to help them with a social support structure as they get their sea legs after they land. It could be. 

You need to identify what pay in Canada/Australia is equivalent to the 1.6 lpm.  Then identify jobs that pay that in respective countries and then identify cities that would make your chances of achieving that better. 

For factors such as free/subsidized medical, education and to some extent a higher standard of living (to each his own). It is definitely worth doing it. 

Happy to answer in private too. Especially about Australia. Or even New Zealand. So this might be a one off case but even younger Indian who are in their 20s or 30s can experience a massive culture shock.

Eg 1 : My friend and his two kids stayed in Boston. So Indians are known as a race who hits their kid to discipline them (also  known as child abuse ). So his kid's friends and teachers had taught the kid that they can call the police if their parents hit them. 

His kids were the worst pieces of unruly shit I have ever laid my eyes upon. He and his wife literally went mad trying to discipline them. The kids used to threaten to call the police or complain to teacher if they hit them. So the parents were quite shocked and unable to control their kids. They eventually moved back to India.

Eg 2: if you are a conservative Indian, be prepared for your kids teenage years. They will date other people, probably indulge in casual sex, have secret alcohol parties. Dress skimpily and post tons of those pics on fb, Instagram etc. This is just pretty much inevitable and pretty common in the west. 

I have a modern friend who is well travelled, well read, rich and comfortable but just can't sleep because his teenage daughter was dating someone and loved partying and dancing. They can compromise on many things but kid's possible promiscuity is something they can't adjust to. 

This was few observations from a a decade ago or so. Depends on your line of work too, I guess. A 1.6 LPM friend of mine moved to Canada for MBA (he was in IT here before that) and struggled to find a job in business/management. So switched to IT after doing his MBA since he saw better job prospects here. Within Canada there are a lot of variations as well. Vancouver and Toronto metro areas are expensive and you will definitely have to sacrifice on some of your comforts. Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Winnipeg and Halifax are far more affordable. Halifax is a booming city now with a growing tech industry and pretty affordable. Canada isn’t as high paying as the US. But it’s offset by free healthcare, education & the environment there. It’s a massive pain to adjust to any new country. 

Even if you find a job that pays 100k CAD a year, the adjustments you need to make in terms of social settings will stay the same. 

But, depending on where in Canada you are for example GTA - you’ll find a robust Indian community. Canadians are in general more welcoming of immigrants vs other countries in the current scenario. 

Australia is just way too racist for my personal taste. They’ve a very rigid set of thinking & have an intellectual superiority complex in the work place & there is a Trump like PM in Australia now.

46,AskIndia,"Boiled Eggs + Banana Idli obviously with Idli powder. Or you can go for Pongal alternatively. The brits have a saying about 5 a day, which is 5 fruit and veg in a day. I try to keep that up with cheap ingredients.

Lentils are cheap and a good source of fibre and protein. So dal with rice, then whatever cheap seasonal veggies I can get my hands on. Bottle gourd, spinach, cauliflour etc. I make a batch of poriyal with each one, then mix and match for a week. Different lentils so I don't feel like I'm having the same thing over and over.

Idli with sambar is cheap too. 

Eggs, in different ways. Like in fried rice with some veggues left after making a big batch of poriyal. Or egg curry with idli.

When buying chicken, I buy the whole thing. I use the legs for curry, breasts for something like chicken 65, leftover meat for salad. The bones make a good stock, which can be used with the eggs and leftover meat for Chinese sweet corn chicken soup.

The trick is to learn how to use every ingredient in many things, as well as how to repurpose leftovers in a different tasting dish. I used these dishes when I was in India, and now that I live in a very expensive country, I use them even more. I just replace Indian veggies with the local cheap ones like broccoli and zucchini.

We Indians tend to consume a lot of carbohydrates and fats and minimal proteins. Those who advocate lentil based diets tend to miss the point that the quality of the proteins isn't comparable to animal based proteins. Another important point is the fact that diets high on lentils and fiber have less protein available for absorption though calculated values may far exceed the reality at the level of the small intestine. A diet based on animal protein is your best bet for good growth. Plant based proteins that can replace animal protein based diets are still expensive and not widely available.

48,AskIndia,"Pvt Ltd or LLP are indeed better than OPC, but if you're solo and don't want to involve anyone, it's better to go with OPC than a Proprietorship. In fact, unless you're taking outside investment or have more than one partner (i.e. yourself), I would even recommend to go for an OPC instead of a Pvt Ltd.

OPCs get treated like Pvt Ltds in all matters but don't have the same compliance burden. 

You're also overthinking this. Register a company (don't need dedicated office; just need address proof) first. Once that's done, talk to a CA about registering trademarks.

Also, this isn't shit you should be DIYing. Hire a CA. If you hope to be a founder, you'll have to delegate. Financial and compliance matters are not in your domain of expertise, so offload them to people who specialize in these things. Few of my inputs

1. **Don't incorporate a LLP or Company unless external reasons require you to do so.** They only add additional compliance expenses, closing them down is lengthy and expensive process and they provide no additional value. Forget what you read about limited liability you read online, this is India not USA.
2. **If you have to incorporate, create a LLP instead of OPC or Limited company.** Otherwise, if you end up making good money, it will be locked up in company account and a you can't withdraw without paying additional dividend tax. You can always convert a LLP to company if needed, but converting a company to LLP has lot of rules and waiting period.
3. **Hire a CA.** Don't do all legal stuff yourself.

I'd like to stress here that though the process is considered simpler now, it seems far too bureaucratic  for a IT simpleton like me. From what I have read and understood:

* LLP or Private Limited are better than OPC (why?)
* LLP or PL need 3 people, while OPC needs one and one for nomination
* register company, get some secure USB token
* register trade marks (but no idea how to register different company names and products - like One97 and Paytm) for apt classes (35 to 45) or in all of them
* dedicated Office : needed or not?
* GST, VAT, etc :  what's needed and when?

Automation is actually a good step up if you want to get into programming. You can start from there and slowly build up. Meanwhile, you can keep preparing and practicing programming in your spare time. I can recommend a few online courses as well if you're really interested.

What were the differences?","[AskIndia] Indians that have visited our neighbouring countries, what were the similarities you noticed? What were the differences?"
53,AskIndia,"> What were the differences?

Sri Lanka: Very clean, even in poorer villages. Everyone I met was so polite and courteous. No one was trying to hustle the tourists. Auto drivers would only ask once, politely, if you needed a ride. Policeman did not harass me for a broken number plate; he actually fixed it himself! Roads were good, lanes and crossings were marked and traffic was more courteous than India. 

On my last day in Colombo there was a street party going on in the center of the city. Alcohol was being served. There was a DJ and people were dancing. But there was no one harassing girls, fighting with each other or being uncouth. I can't imagine anything like that in India!

For a country ravaged by civil war, I did not expect it to be so much better than India for tourists. Similar experience in Bali/Indonesia. 

I used to attribute all our problems to poverty and lack of educations. But now I question that. Why are these places nicer? Been to Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Maldives. 

As others mentioned Sri Lanka is what India should be. It's a lot cleaner, organized, and civilized. People don't push, spit, shove as much. It has a higher per capita income than India I think even though it had a long civil war. the govt did a way better job investing education and basic infrastructure like roads 

Maldives is also a relatively rich country with a per capita GDP 40% higher than India, I imagine thanks in part to tourism and its small population. Male the capital city is quite clean and organized. People acted quite civilized and polite though out on the islands its quite poor. Again, I wish India could be like this but I think parts of South India like Kerala actually are similar. Similar culture actually. 

Bangladesh. Dhaka reminded me of India exactly, could not even really tell a major difference. All of the problems with traffic, pollution, people's behavior, maybe even worse because things like the airport, roads etc are like 1990 style India. One and the same. If you walked around Dhaka without knowing it was a different country you'd have no idea

Nepal: also very similar to India but maybe a bit more polite, clean, but not anymore organized. It's poorer than India for sure and from what I've read it will be hard for them to significantly boast their economy compared to India in the future Nepal: it is amazing experience that there is no incessant  honking in traffic unlike India. Nepal gaya hun bhai uska bataon? Bali: an island with majority hindu population in a muslim majority country

Similarity: views on muslims on general. Basically muslims are Bad guys. Hindu religion, gods they worship

Difference: they had beef in offerings to god, women and men worked side by side on normal jobs, seemed more religious (lot more religious ceremony part of day to day life), lot more focus on cleanliness and beauty and art.

Somehow i had a feeling that hinduism was an old branch ... More true to vaidic times without muslim influence like we have had. Nepal: The only place where I saw a mandir with a board outside saying ""No dogs or non-Hindus allowed."" It was wierd standing within the walls of that mandir and seeing all the foreigners looking through their binoculars from far away.
Also, the Hyatt Hotel there had a casino and burlesque night show! Another stark difference from India.

Also, Buy Dominar. Try Jawa. Waiting period is long though. I'll address all the recommendations in this thread with my opinion. I spent a lot of time researching bikes this year prior to my own purchase.

Duke 125/200 / MT15 - Do not have comfortable pillion seats. I had to throw them out of my head for that reason alone.

Dominar - Meets and maybe even exceeds expectation for the price, but is expensive.

FZ25 - A good machine overall, fits in your budget perfectly.

Apache RTR 200 - I own this. If your touring needs are that light, you'll find yourself more than satisfied. It's extremely fun (rev happy), has a comfortable pillion seat and a very satisfying power band. You'll save some money too.

FZv3/Hornet - They have significantly lower power numbers. The Hornet is also quite handsomely priced for what it is. They're not as *fun* to ride as the other motorcycles on this list, but are great for mileage and pillion comfort.

Get test rides and more importantly, **get dual channel ABS**. Have you considered the Dominar? Will require stretching your budget by 30k though. A tourer's dream.

But do test ride it regardless. And check if local service centers have good reviews. FZv3 or MT15 FZV3 or Honda Hornet. Exceeding the budget, could go for Dominar.

3) the shitty shitty whyphy, motherfucker i want to kill the salesman who said i would be getting 50-60 mbps, the speed that i get is even lower than their low speed data that should be around 1 mbps, fucker reminds me of the gprs/edge days which still might be faster because of low data requirement for the page  

4) the stupidest and tardiest customer service ever, first you have to wait a whoopass 20 fucking minutes on the phone listening to the fucking jio tone or whatever, if that doesn't fry your brains, then the customer service guy/gal will. they are the fucking most typical indian customer service guys you can imagine. For a moment I thought i was in the south park episode with customer support and the vr headset. If you have seen Kenny's and kanan's maa ki dal sketch, then this guy is even worse than kenny. the same guy is the customer support and the floor manager and the technical team and yet they don't know shit

 * how is your wi-fi speed, please tell me it gets better  
 * and yes any data hoarder or torrent user, does gigafiber have port forwarding, i have made all firewall exceptions, enabled upnp and still not able to open a port  

edit: i mentioned port forwarding in the last line incorrectly, i wanted to know about upnp support on jio, cause  with most CGNAT enabled isps, asking for static ip's becomes costly, so i had been using upnp to seed which can be easily enabled on the modem webpage. previously i had been using airtel and they had this service, what is the case with jio?",[AskIndia] How is your Jio Gigafiber connection

What is this major problem? Equal opportunity doesn’t mean equal outcome. You can create reservations for women in politics but it doesn’t necessarily mean that more women will be inclined to join politics. All you can do is create awareness and leave the choice to them. Why just stop there? Reserve 70-80% seats for backward castes because that's their true population proportion. I don't know how i feel about reservations in general. But if we do implement reservation then why not make it proportional to the actual ratio of men and women? Even if this happens, most seats will be won by women who will be the puppets of their husbands/family, aka Ravri Devi. There needs to be good governance set in place, the probability of an independent woman making it to the top is very less in India unless she's already having a career in politics, which most seats won't have.

68,AskIndia,"I lost my father exactly 1 year ago yesterday. Although he was a diabetic but there was never a complication. Then suddenly he suffered a heart stroke and that was it. I unfortunately wasn’t with him in his last moments. 

I had always practiced this event in my mind that one day he won’t be there. But when you hear this news you don’t seem to comprehend it. Nothing makes sense to you at all. All the plans you had made are now gone. You had planned for a surprise family holiday? It’s gone. You wanted to discuss some random stuff with him? Not possible. You wanted to buy him a new tool kit? Not possible. 

The initial 2-3 months are the worst while your mind rewrites or reroutes your thoughts to navigate around the void that’s  just been created. Your keep asking yourself what if you had done that or what if you were there etc .

And then gradually time heals everything and you learn to live with his memories. Life goes on. I lost my mom before my 10th grade exams and my dad 3 months ago.... I'm currently writing my final sem exams. It sucks big time especially when you're not expecting someone to just go away suddenly - the case with my dad. 


Both my mom and dad had chronic illnesses, I don't even wanna name what the illnesses were coz they were so bad I wish nobody has to go through what they went through. Hospital and medical expenditure was so high that we couldn't save a penny and as result, right now, my final condition is very pathetic and I have two sisters to take care of. We still don't have our own house we still live in a rented house in 2019, we have no property, no land, nothing. Most of our relatives are scums, they never supported my dad when he was ill and we don't expect anything from them so we like to maintain our distance.


Mentally speaking, I'm depressed, hopeless, shattered. I still am not over my Dad's death. He would have lived had he agreed to go to the hospital earlier so there will always be this guilt with me, I'll always feel like I couldn't save my dad and I have to live with it.


 Speaking of the future, I just don't know what to do now from here. Nothing's going the right way for me. My dream is to crack UPSC civil services exam but UPSC will take time and i don't have time, i have to find a job quick asap after my exams so I'll probably do some odd jobs and give some easier government exams for now and then I'll see what I can do. 


It's like I don't have a purpose for living anymore but I'm trying. Trust me, nothing is worse than losing both your parents. Please spend everyday with your parents like it would be their last so you don't have any regrets like me. Life is cruel and you cannot predict what's going to happen next. Lost my Dad in 2016. I've never been truly happy since then. I always get stressed or mad at even the most silliest thing and it's genuinely ruining my life. Haven't yet managed to think that he's truly gone. :( Depends on what age you lose them, what kind of relation you had, and your own nature.

When you get older and lose them, you get over it faster.  If they were suffering from a major illness, you will be relieved that they are gone.

Help regarding JEE Mains."
74,AskIndia,"[deleted] Hey, I am fighting a domestic violence case filed against me by my wife. There are a few things I want to share.            

First things first. Custody mostly goes to mothers and the fathers get visitation rights on weekends, festivals etc. The legal system in India is highly biased in favor of women. Not to discourage you, but adultery in India is very difficult to prove. In one case, a man produced pictures of his wife in compromised positions with another man, and in turn his wife filed a new case of outraging her modesty. It is not impossible, but difficult.       
      
Now, main issue: money. Everything will come down to money. How much are you willing to give to her so that she says yes for a divorce. They call it settlement, which in easy words is extortion. Everybody in the system, right from clerk to judge will ask you to settle. Lumpsum money or else monthly maintenance for her. If you file a divorce, chances are you will get a 498A, DV, 125 package in return.      
      
This are some of the problems, now some solutions. Main: gather all the evidences that you can, each & everything, document everything and she shouldn't know about it. Gather her job records & salary slips (if she is working) and education records (if she isn't working). List down all your assets and liabilities. Document stuff that shows she has been a careless mother.      
      
If you are able to prove adultery beyond a reasonable doubt, you have cracked it. SC said that a wife committing adultery is not entitled to get any maintenance or other monetary benefits.        
      
Most importantly, keep a cool head. Don't lose heart. Happens with many of us and you are not the only one who is wronged. Be motivated and never lose your focus on your job/work. Your value is just because of your job/work.  Document everything. Meticulously. Chat msgs from years back, your paper documents, the money you both spent, everything. As detailed as you can. You never know what can come useful. Don't confront until you have solid evidence.

Custody is something that usually isn't affected by adultery. As in you aren't going to get full custody simply because of the fact that your wife cheated. Economics and stable environment are the key factors there.

The simplest way to get access to FB or phone lock is to stand behind the person when they're unlocking and sneak a look. Then ask to make a call or something and use it. There's no magic hacking apps or something like that so try not to download a virus in the enthusiasm.

Stay calm, go take a walk or a long shower. As in chess, when you're position is disadvantaged, it's time to slow down, consolidate your position and think about the next move carefully. Not throw the game in anger. Good luck and keep us posted OP. [removed] I’d recommend you in any emergency case of a 498A/125DV, connect to Shonee Kapoor. This guy literally nailed his own case with a victory (Adultery and post that False 498A. Court had quashed his case and he didn’t have to give any kind of maintenance)

Hope you are fine brother. Please collect as much evidence as you can. Phone call recordings, pictures, chats, SMSes, every goddamn thing you have against her.

Very high probability that the opposition lawyer will suggest your wife to file all those 498A 125DV bullshit charges for sure so that they could harass you more.

Hell, these things literally deter me from getting married in the future. [removed] women tend to have an upper hand in these situations my question is the person married or not? Sorry to hear that buddy. I can only wish you good luck... and offer you a beer. Keep your chin up. Take a paternity test. Sincerely Dude consult a family lawyer he would be able to give you far better advice than any user out here. Marriage and divorce are huge thing in India so there is no escaping the family drama. Lesson learnt. Never gonna get married
 First up, remove the personal details you have supplied in the first post. Can easily be passed on to your spouse if somebody connected + adept at reddit goes through it. 1) Adultery is grounds for divorce.

2) Regarding custody. It is generally true that it is awarded to the mother. However, in this case her behaviour would be a strong consideration to award it to you.

Disclaimer: nothing in this comment should be construed as legal advice. Please contact a lawyer. From now on you may want to screenshot all chats with her and also record phone conversations.  > What kind of technology can I use to monitor her email, phone (voice and text), social media communications (Fb) for few days? 

Do not go down this path. You'll come out worse off than before.  How did you find out ?  Is the evidence fool proof?

Who is the guy she is cheating with? Hey, I'm a little late to the thread, but I thought I'd chime in, a bit, being a lawyer. 

You're being remarkably level-headed about this, which  is a huge plus. that being said, I understand your motivation to gather evidence, but make sure you do nothing illegal. You don't want to have a criminal case against you, and, as others have said, our judicial system is quite biased towards women. A competent lawyer could easily allege stalking, outraging the modesty of a woman, indecency, etc. 

Another thing is to make sure you go to the right lawyer. You mentioned you're going to the best lawyer in the city. Make sure he/she also practices in the district courts, where your case will be filed. The best lawyers usually tend to practice in High Courts and the Supreme Court, and lose touch with trial court practice. 

If you have anything you need to ask, feel free to message me. I hope everything works out for you. Hit the lawyer, Delete Gym, Facebook Up. If you have multiple devices lying around like an extra tablet, iPad and by any chance if she's logged into FB on those device/s you could use that to read her FB chat logs and take screenshots. 
Don't confront her without evidence plan with your lawyer. 
I have no experience but I have read and seen movies and I'm speaking from those stories.  Pretty sure you are taking the right decision. Get off that cheating piece of shit. erm, pretty sure it's illegal to monitor her email/phone i will not recconmend you to do any spying on her phone but ....but you can use some simple technique to unlock her phone when she is not there ..and also fb or whatsapp massage willnot b a better evidence as u need hard evidence a video or photograph ...maybe install a webcam  Look dude i don't have any idea about this stuff but most of the people here are saying to gather enough evidence so i will suggest try to hire a private investigator who will help you with that stuff, also contact your lawyer about this. If you don't have any evidence, then play it cool. Or else, she will figure out something is up, and guess you know. In which case, she might file fake domestic violence charges against you to make your future claims look unreliable. Also, I would recommend you delete this post too. Just in case she or her lover frequents this sub. firstly freeze your bank accounts and other valuables so that wife does not have access...then collect as many evidences as possible video and audio recordings work best..after all this confront your wife and ask your divorce..tell her that you have strong evidences if she resists Hey OP, firstly I’m really sorry to know you’re in such a situation. It sucks. However you seem to have a level headed plan for the future. Don’t listen to folks who are suggesting you to stay married just for the sake of kids/ family blah blah blah. Cheating is a dealbreaker and nothing can amend that.

The toughest part is the legal battle ahead of you and you making sure that you don’t end up with a bad deal by the court. Therefore, don’t confront. Gather evidence. Pretend to act normal until you have it all and are confident that your case is strong. Only then proceed with filing a case etc. 

Best of luck OP. More power to you.  Whether you want a divorce or not is entirely your decision. Don't listen to any of the toxic advice on here regarding that. 

The best thing you can do now is think of her purely as the mother of your children and not your wife. Try and be as mature as you possibly can for the sake of your children. 

Asking for full custody of your children (hence depriving them of a mother) because she cheated on you is unfair on you, her and MOST importantly your children. It will also make you look vengeful and petty. More than that it will really affect your relationship with your kids in the future. Her cheating on you is no indication of her being a bad mother. 

Lastly, for god's sake DO NOT try to track her communication, stalk her or snoop around. As you know it's illegal and if the court/she find out, it will make you look really, really bad. You say you are not planning to do that to gather evidence for the court. Why else are you doing this then? How on earth will doing this help you deal with the situation? You say she is dramatic but if you do this then you are fighting fire with fire. 

Go to a good lawyer and listen to them. Reddit is not the place to get advice for this stuff. This place is full of immature teens and young adults who have no idea what you are going through and they've probably never been in a relationship before. They are (self-admittedly) giving you advice based on movies!! You don't need this right now. Go to a lawyer and stop listening to reddit. 

I'm sorry for what you are going through. I hope you are able to deal with this well and be there for your children. This is going to be really difficult for them so try and make it as easy as possible for them. Don't make them choose between you and her, they need both parents. Good luck OP :) Fucking hoes man. And the damage is almost unrepairable. 
Been so long,  I still can't trust anyone. 
Good luck mate. How old are your kids? It's very difficult for the father to get custody of his teenage children. You should take advice from the PI only regarding snooping her. Is that even legal? And why don't you confront her, it will be messy but might really prevent some miscommunication on your part. You can't monitor her phone and social media, that's illegal.  Don't break the law as part of collecting evidence any sensible lawyer she hires will have that shit thrown out and hurt your case irreparably. I'd say it's lucky that she doesn't know you know, keep it that way and follow the advice of your lawyer. Hello OP, sorry to read about the pain you are experiencing. I know that extra marital affairs have become extremely common in India and most people including the cheating spouse are not aware of the problems and pains it causes, which can be extreme. Many people have given you advice in this thread so I won't try to offer you that, but I request something from you. From reading your replies it is clear that you have experienced a great psychological trauma. I want you to please share your thoughts and feelings about this major incident of your life. What went through your mind, did you feel disgusted, insulted, outraged, what kind of topics did you think a lot upon, etc. I think this will help many people who are reading this thread and it may also help you release some built-up pressure by explaining in detail your pain and suffering. I'll be very obliged. a. In cases of adultery, the married one most of the times isn't willing to give up the marriage for the lover's sake. The lover is dropped like a hot potato when the marriage is at stake. If you are open for reconciliation, you can go through therapy to fix things. Obviously it's hard to place faith in someone involved in infidelity. But it's your choice. You have kids. If you don't want your kids to grow up without their mother, you can consider this option.

b. Technical info like call logs, location history etc. is tracked by Google Activity by default unless turned off. But you need access to her gmail id to avail that. It could be add on to whatever you gather from PI. 

Wish you the courage and strength to face this difficult times.  [deleted] Welcome to the club. Enjoy your future days !!! [deleted] When you finally decide to talk this over make sure you are ready with all sorts of trail and evidence. Ok I know you’re upset and you have every right to be, but you’re asking for full custody because she cheated? You’re going to take your anger which you justifiably have towards your wife on your children by depriving them of their mother. I’m not sure how the law works where you are but where I am, emails and all that begotten without consent of the other person do not count in a court of law. Hire a PI. And also, do what’s best for your kids. She may be a shit wife but she has a right also to her children.  This is not the right forum. Consult, r/relationships, r/relationship_advice, specifically mention that you are in India. Hi, its upsetting to read this, but from my experience of being standing and seeings a frnds irreparable marriage.. i would like to suggest something.. is it the first instance this this is happening? I mean had your alwaays marriage been in problems? How did this all start..? The the distance between 2 of you increasing after any particular event? What i want to say is the the cheating only reason? Had she never loved you? The cheating is more of a need for love or togetherness or just cheating? Also one more thing.. has your daily life with her gone worse.. like daily fights or and things? Or u just act cool and she does too? Just pretend we all are cool and lovely?

 I may sound wrong.. but we all know when things start to go wrong, the distance between people starts increasing.. if you really love her.. and you can find a human reason for what she is doing can that can be repaired.. i would suggest you take a higher stand than her.. i know its hard. But at the end you would know u are better, u gave her chance.. maybe there might be some mistakes u must have made on the way, that she wanted to distance from you.. and find love somewhere else . But you know we are humans, and we need love .
The only thing i would to suggest you is if feel this is not cause of the distance that had been growing since time . U keep gathering your evidence.. and keep it safe.. look it at a perspective of why would she do that.. find a reason in those evidences and history u have together.. sometimes people drift away in search of love... I donno who to blame in these cases.. but as a person with understanding the human nature can we give try to give human instinct some chance? I think we can... 

From my experience.. i would suggest u gather evidences, with mere goal of knowing whats wrong( if this looks more like cheating than just a person trying to go away)..u will know if its  a sexual escapade or a find for love.. u will be able to see those in chats or anything.. while at it, i would suggest u try to talk to her.. not openly.. maybe ask her whats wrong why has your relationship detoriated over time(if it has) maybe she wont open up.. it will take time.. make sure you u dont sound like u are accusing her of cheating... Coz  that thing is going to make her feel guilty as hell and she wont let u know anything further..

If your goal is to just leave her.. then dont think about what i have said above.. but is you plan it know things and what has gone wrong, coz all this pain you and u cant bliv this has happened.. u can try to talk and know whats wrong.. no need to present evidences.. maybe she comes back if she starts to realise the distance has increased and she has done a grave mistake.. 

All d best OP. We humans are the capable of mistake as well as forgiveness.. dont forget this dont need to continue.. u may have already tried all those things i have said above.. maybe u are at the brink on ""no way out"".. so i can understand.. u need to have ur freedom too.. ur peace of mind too.. have a great day OP. [deleted] I can give you the exact value of PI. Don't monitor her personal stuff. It doesn't look good on your part.

Questions you need answer to yourself.  how is she as a mother? Would the kids be okay with you getting sole custody? It seems like you have not confronted with her yet. May be you have not been available much to her. She is human after all. This is perfectly repairable, you need to be more understanding and accepting. Don't take this step. Ignore other guys advising about divorce, collecting proof etc. It depends :

1. Try to hint to her and warn. See if it can improve the situation.

2. If you really love her or she loves you, there is still hope.

3. If you believe in virginity and all those stuff.

4. By all means try to fix it and live with her. Else life of kids will be a mess. If mother has affair that can hurt kids badly (if father has affair, not that much).

Think well and decide. 
All the best.  Man. Try to amend this relationship. You are breaking your home.

You are looking into years of litigation, including dowry, maintainance, child custody, and possibly defamation/rape/more if your wife is clever. Your whole life will become a mess. Children divided.

Do yourself a favor. Don't get involved in this mess. I am facing such mess and it's not worth it.

Give her one last warning. And discuss the problems frankly with her. Maybe you are not giving her enough time. She is a human after all.

75,AskIndia,"Eat fit is already doing it. Stealing your idea. Cya later I think it would be a good idea. There used to be a few services like this in Bangalore (redcooker or something along those lines). 

Why not go for a model like Blue Apron in the US, wherein the user subscribes for pre portioned ingredients with recipes in a way that's user friendly for beginners to make? I love to cook and experiment, but the daily grind ensures that 90% of the time I end up eating out or ordering takeaways.  Sounds like a good idea to me. I'd definitely use it and would be willing to pay a little extra, just don't make a fool of customers with exorbitant airport like prices for tiny portions. Absolute hygiene is my number 1 priority. Glove, cap and sterilize the shit out of everything possible. And dont just say it.Give us proof. Get external agenices to audit the hygiene(if such agencies exist) and also post thorough Hygiene standards and rules so that we can hold you accountable. Put uo youtube videos of kitchen tours. Ok now lets come to nutriton. Obviously do your research and make everything healthy but also add an Organic tier. The Organic variety should have the main things like chcken and milk sourced orgamically, i.e., without pesticides or hormones etc. And lastly money. You guys need to make the least possible profit that fits your model or else this system fails. And Also reach out to cities where similar services dont exist yet(cover all the metros to begin with). Thats about it :) Honestly I guess you guys are already done with all the planning and investing phase and are going to launch soon so whats done is done, but still one can hope, can he not Done. FYI there is an app on Google play store called ""Fofi"" which does the same. Restricted to Chennai though. Like Tinmen?  Where is your would be startup based?  How is this different from eat. fit or half a dozen 'health food' restaurants listed on swiggy right now?

I was witness to the great ""food tech"" boom of 2014, couple of which promised calorie counted, nutrition counted, healthy meals. None of them survived. Why not become an aggregator for homechefs? There are quite a few home run catering services and mom's who cook everyday for their family, if they have an extra meal which might be wasted or forcefully eaten, you can use it and just need to take care of packaging and delivery. Homemade meal averages out to Rs 30 per meal (3 rotis, daal and one veg), you can buy it for 50 and then sell it with packaging and delivery for a nominal profit and at the same time get mom's in to the gig economy.  All the best, OP. Check out [Food darzee](https://www.fooddarzee.com/) if you haven't already. They pretty much do the same. A suggestion: Give detailed nutritional detail for each meal plan, to be viewed upon button click or something. And maintain the quality and taste of food while meeting the nutritional detail exactly.  Box8 also did this, cooking food and delivering it, but I doubt they couldn't run this long. Also, any type of delivery business is the worst idea.

Edit - in Mumbai, some restaurant also does it on personal portal like hellogreen.in Eat.fit-Cult is already there I am a budget user. If i get healthy meals at 50 - 70. I will be more than happy. 

* Curefit is very costly. Suppose each meal cost around 150. So for 25 days it comes around as 3750. Which is 25% of 15000 rupees.
* 15000 rupees is standard salary of freshers, BPO people who are in large numbers. So curefir meals constitute 25% of salary,
* If you bring the cost to 1/3 rd  of 3750 i.e 1250 will be glad to buy it. definitely an untapped and good idea in india! try to include more of local stuff unlike ichef. also follow try following blue apron's business model as something on the side for cheaper prices. i definitely see potential in mumbai.  actually sounds like a good idea.  Definitely sounds like a good idea for big cities. Cult fitness in bangalore already does it and it looks popular- at least from zomato reviews.

My only request would be eco friendly/bio-degradable packaging, if you are moving forward with the idea.  another one? I used one app, TinMen which does exactly this. Check the food subscriptions here in US, you may be inspired. Subscriptions here send portioned out meal kits to make your own food, this works because you don't need to do any shopping or measure quantities. There's a spice only subscription too. You mean [eat.fit](https://eat.fit) version 2.0 ? Gym diet please! I can't make chicken at home will eat outside if there's a tiffin app  The market is already saturated with similar services. Since you are entering a crowded space, your customer acquisition costs for the first 2 years are going to be very high.

Inspite of all the odds , the Indian consumer is moving towards healthy and organic food and there is still a huge market for it, if your able to offer something unique to consumers, you will succeed. I personally would love a good app based tiffin service, I have tried some, but the food becomes too routine after some time and doesn't feel worth the exlenditure anymore. So my suggestion would be to try and make the menu have some surprise elements, so that every meal feels different. Also, I don't know if it's logistically possible, but customizable amount of spices would be a great feature for a tiffin service. That said, all the best OP. I'm going to ask you the same questions I anyone when they talk about their idea.

* The product (what is it, use case, who would want it)
* The market (TAM, size, competition, dynamics to be aware of)
* Product analysis / comparison against competition
* What stage are you in? Do you need money? Are you raising?
* Customer conversion strategy (where do you find them, and how do you make them buy  from you?)
* Why you? Why are YOU the best person for this job? (experience? good team? rich daddy who can't bring himself to pull the plug? what?)
* Have you thought differently about this idea differently? what are you offering that's different from others in the same market? Better business plan would be to import Huel.com from UK and sell it in India on Amazon. Like Swiggy?

I am very methodical and I'll deal with this issue just like that. I am going to write down everything I plan to do, rehearse it multiple times with my lawyer (he responded), plug holes and build a solid case.

There are many suggesting that I don't monitor her activities as it's illegal. I can appreciate that. But I am anyway going to do it. What's important to me primarily is the evidence, the truth and the full picture. What I do with it is totally a different matter altogether. I may not tell her, I may just poke and see the response, I may not not use the evidence for legal proceedings (and that's up to lawyer anyway) or I may just burn it all.

I didn't know such things existed !!  
What science, what technology!!!  
Is this India? Face wash - Avene Cleanance Gel. Costs a bomb but the quantity is huge and value for money.

Moisturiser - ~~Avene~~ Aveeno moisturising lotion. It moisturises really well without making the skin feel oily or greasy.

Shampoo - I usually keep changing them after a few months. Started using St. Botanica recently. Too early to give an opinion.

Soap - I use Biotique Almond Oil soap(for lazy days) and keep trying different body washes. Current one is from Palmolive. I like it because it has a scrubby texture. CeraVe was nice but global shipping on Amazon takes time now I just use Cetaphil.  I have long curly hair so most shampoos make my hair super dry and brittle. I switched to biotique sulphate free shampoo and it has made a huge difference but I dont think biotique is like an expensive brand. 

If you feel something is harsh try to read the ingredients list and pick shampoos and soaps that are milder. I cheap out on a lot of stuff especially make up but the only thing I feel I have to spend money on for quality is perfume.  Life Buoy and Dettol products for asli mard. Patanjali if you want skin cancer. Medimix. The hard green one. Lush. Body Shop.  I'm almost 17 and I use johnsons baby shampoo and my hair is good [deleted] Fabindia Daily Use Shampoo fiama ke bath soap and gel...

especially wo purple wala. All I use is soap. I don't care what soap it is. Usually something normal like Lux, Mysore Sandal,etc. I stopped using everything else. Was addicted to Ponds body lotion for the last 10 years and have been addicted to steaming hot water baths all my life. So I started cold water showers.  I stopped using shampoos and conditioner as well. /r/NoPoo. Also was using hair products like smoothing serum n all of that. I have long hair that goes down to over half of my back.

All of it was starting to become a bit too much really. I used to face a lot of inconvenience while traveling. Cant have a bath if there's no hot water or shampoo/conditioner or body lotion. A lot of maintenance and effort and as a guy i felt i don't have to deal with all of this bullshit. I don't have the time and got more important things to deal with. And life is so much fucking better and simpler now. Now as long as I have just the bare essentials which I need(bath soap, toothbrush, toothpaste and a tongue scraper), im good to go anywhere :) Gaumutra Proraso for all shaving needs. A customer for 9+ years and their products are top tier. Facewash: Bioderma Sebium (Gel)

(I don't have any other options really, since most make me break out while this is has worked amazingly well for me).

Shampoo: L'Oreal Mythic Oil shampoo & Mask

Moisturizer: Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer

(It's a sunscreen too and zero breakouts).

Soap: Prefer a body wash: Neutrogena Rainbath shower gel.

These are non negotiable for me. My shaving cream on the other hand..... Lol....  Shampoo - If you can afford it for regular use Kerastase Densifique is really really good to control hairfall. I have been using it regularly for a year now and results are amazing. Not for dandruff control though. Use something else for that, along with Kerastase Face : Cetaphil cleanser, cerave moisturizer

Hair care : shea moisture shampoo, wow coconut oil conditioner. 

Body : loccitane shea butter soap (this is maybe the best thing I have found in recent years), cerave moisturizer again. 

Shaving : trigodon shaving soap, nivea sensitive after shave balm (this stuff is good)

hair styling : lockhart's goon grease pomade 

Fragrance : a few EDPs from Swiss Arabian (very high quality for the price, especially if you live in uae )

Everything listed here can be bought off of Amazon.in Cetaphil light moisturiser, palmers night cream. Anything non comedogenic is good. Stopped using manufactured bullshit a while back. For shampoo, buy amla, reetha, shikakai, boil it together, if you wanna store, freeze it. Lovely simple stuff for hair.
As an alternative to soaps, face wash, get multani mitti, gulaab jal, dahi, milk, i have a rose powder don't know what it's called, basically take different things, figure out what works well for your skin, mix & match & make ubtan out of it. Tum bhi saaf, Nahane ke baad wala paani bhi saaf.
It's not cheaping out, there really isn't anything in the market I think is good enough. I don't use it because I don't know all the shit they put in it.  Mysore Sandal Soap, Himalaya face wash, Biotique soya shampoo. Anything Nivea. I swear by it. Shaving foam, shampoo, face wash, moisturise r, everything. It's just good. And also not exorbitantly expensive. 

I Just don't find nivea soap that easily,  **Nivea Men's Oil Control Face Wash** - 
It's not really expensive but is a must if you have oily face. Also I love the cool menthol feeling

**Alfred Sung Cologne** -

This scent combines the freshness of basil with the earthy tone of sage. Juniper berries and caraway add a sweet, floral essence to the masculine scent, and its pepper note adds a hint of spiciness. Just one or two sprays will leave you smelling clean and feeling fresh throughout the morning and afternoon.


 search for paul Mitchell on Amazon  I prefer Biotique BioApricot.  Great Body Wash.

&#x200B;

I used Body Shop for a long time. But Biotique is by far the most luxurious and cost effective thing.  Use fiama or nivea men shower gel, i like them both [deleted] If you are with a beard, try Cinthol beard and face wash, beard oil and wax.
They are not cheap. But they are very cheap in comparison to the competition. Coconut virgin oil from Amazon instead of the regular parachute. Costs double but my hair love it. Idk what it is with parachute oil but it sucks. Nothing, it is all bollocks, I use bar soap and coconut oil. Himalaya Neem face wash and Nykaa Rosehip Oil for moisturiser  I would recommend Mysore sandal soap. It has the highest TFM 80%. Medimix soap. The BodyShop, Clinique

&#x200B;

Edit: About two months back switched to Skinkraft's range of customized face care products(cleanser, moisturizer and night cream). I am not using them daily as recommended, but have noticed a difference in appearance, mainly, more clear skin and fading of some dark spots. The main compliment I can give them is that there products do not cause any irritation.  Nivea all the way.
Body wash,
Face creme,
Moisturizer,
Chapstick,
Face wash,
Cleansing milk.

That's my nivea routine Soap - Life boy and Dettol. Despite all the shit about scented and what not by the competition, there's one thing you must remember. You live in India. Everything smells, you need as much anti-bacterial stuff as humanly possible to remain alive. So ditched the scented stuff and stick to Life Bouy and Dettol # Patanjali Forever My favorite soap is Cuticura. Rest I am yet to find something that I can stick to. Currently using Brylcreem Shampoo and Bombay Shaving Company face wash. Both are fine.  Old Spice. The body wash and underarm sticks from the US, cream and aftershave from here. 
 Anyone follows this YouTube channel Fit Tuber. He made a series about all these products based on ingredients. His claims are scientific but I'm not able to confirm them. Does anyone know how valid his claims are? Neutrogena facewash Cetaphil is an amazing face cleanser. It's worth a buy. 
For body products the body shop is one of the best brands you can buy. 
And , Boutique is another. The difference being, boutique is relatively cheap.  Kama ayurveda is good  Was recommended by a friend - small-ish company based in Pune called Vaidyam Healthcare. 

I have been using their hair oil. It did make a lot of difference. All their products are chemical free, so that's something. they have listed out all the ingredients they've used. It's good to know when a company is honest. Also I have started using their body butter as well. Good stuff, reduced my acne as well. Don't need any other creams/ moisturizers anymore. 

Face wash - Clean and Clear

Shampoo - Pure Elements, Rosemary Lemon Khadi.  Aha Glow for face wash, just awesome... Patanjali You should checkout fittuber [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6Vcczj8v-Y5OgpEJTFBw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6Vcczj8v-Y5OgpEJTFBw)

Nobody wants to feel shit because their life is fucked up. So they will capitalize every opportunity in the name of ""wisdom"". It's a common defense mechanism for such people. Because 

1. They want to fuck up your life too.
2. They have nothing else to do.
3. Their own kids do not listen to them and they are depressed. [removed] [removed] I never understand this. How elders think it's right for them to give unsolicited advice, but when i gave unsolicited advice to them, they get offended. 🤷 Was having my breakfast on the go while waiting for my cab, an elderly lady stops, tells me without anyy greetings, beta zindagi me yaad rakhna kabhi aaj ke baad chaurahe ke beech khade hoke khana mat khana!
And mf just walks away????

How do i disable these pop up notifications  indians believe a person should get respect on basis of his age not for the person he is. youngesters are expected to respect them and elders are expected to guide youngsters and young one is expected to follow that advice. it's just social expectation from elders to give advice  Superiority complex, mixed with the fact that they have a sense of pride and entitlement, that only god knows where it comes from.

Just had 2 uncles I barely know lecture me about my future career plans, with incorrect information and textbook suggestions and just straight away told me all my future plans are shit and they know better, when they themselves are living a less than mediocre life. Kept staring at my shoes and taunting me how I'll earn the littlest amount of money get lost in brands (the only brand he named was Nike, cause he kept glancing at my shoes) and how after that I'll throw away my money and ruin my life.

So when you get this ""free ki advice"", just ""smile and nod boys, smile and nod."" You learn from experiences and they advice you not to take decisions that they took which fucked up their life. I guess cause Indian society is more family oriented compared to western societies which tend to be more individualistic. Eastern countries have historically had a more community/family based social dynamics , look at Japan, China , India etc or its just that they are looking out for someone they care about .  Everyone is clueless but we all want a better life. Doesn't matter if you listen to them or not. What does matter is YOU can show them a way to better life.  Speaking from their experiences. Hey man if you feel it's good advice follow it, if not let it slide. It's not like they keep nagging you. If they are in case just tell that ""mom told me not to listen to you"" Worked couple of times.  They have a lot of free time.  Shastron me ise muft ka gyaan pelna kaha Gaya hai.

Nitin Gadkari: the RSS' Man Friday.

 KCR could emerge as the dark horse if BJP's solo tally falls below 180. He has Jagan's support and has good relations with Stalin, Kumaraswamy and Mamata. And moreover,  his intention to devolve as many powers as possible to the states will have strong backing the regional parties. They could form a block post-poll and could form the govt. with support from Congress and SP+BSP.

Also, being from the south and having the ability to speak hindi very effectively, he can build up a pan-India appeal. Ye kya hai? ಹಾಸ್ಯಾಸ್ಪದ/Hāsyāspada/Ridiculous

You eliminate Rahul from the start when his party will be second largest party. Without INC there is no opposition coalition. 

Mayawati and Mamta will both have half the seats of INC so why how are they more likely contendors? 

I'm not saying it **has** to be him. But he will be one contendor. 

If TDP doesn't tank in AP then Chandrababu Naidu could also be a strong contender. 

It is also possible an outside consensus candidate will be chosen.

80,AskIndia,"I overheard an old age aunty saying I love you to her husband. Made me smile.  After many many years, I just wandered around aimlessly on a two wheeler to explore surroundings last week. Found out there were 4-5 farms in 5km radius of my house, saw roads where they had good asphalt but nobody uses them, developed layouts with acres of empty land and a lot of cattle. It felt like a developed village with a dairy and old houses. There was a temple and outside a lot of old people sat to chat in the evening. I joined them and the chat went from their childhood stories to their oldage stories, their efforts and how you need to be a good person before a rich person.

It felt like I paused a day off my normal schedule and experienced something so small yet so beautiful.  Motu the dog barked for exactly 134 minutes straight last afternoon. Motu needs to stfu [deleted] A sweet Bhabhiji slipped down in the mud at bus stop yesterday morning. She was screaming at her son for being serious on exam day while the 7 year old bachcha was singing a song. I saw a dead cat yesterday. He was a stray but me and neighbours used to feed him.
RIP. Today morning I woke up  I am looking for a new job since people higher up the ladder blame the lowest pebble (me) for anything that goes wrong. My roommate got a job offer that pays more than his current manager's salary. We spent a while talking about the incompetent middle management at his current company and then went to the roof and had a few beers.

Also saw two kids popping wheelies on a beater 100cc bike. The second dude was almost hanging from the back in order to create enough leverage for the front wheel to stay up. I had deleted Ola app because of Rs.50 cancellation fee it slapped on me. But yesterday, I had to book Ola auto for my aunts. So, after a gap of almost 6 months, I re-installed Ola app and paid the damn fine (100 rupees) and booked Ola auto ride. [removed] After a long time, I went to skiing with my friends to Gulmarg. We stayed the night there and during sunset looking at those mighty Himalayas was one of the best sights I have seen till far by now.  A stray cat mom abandoned her 2 kitties in the building I stay. These kitties have settled to staying on the stairs and running up and down when someone uses the stairs. I ended up pitying them and kept milk and some cat food at my house doorsteps and they started to trust me. This was all cute and fun until they decided to play with our shoes, threw my nikes outside the building and shat all our entrance lol. Don't know how to respond to them now I am aiming to get my first job this summer. 
 After dropping my brother at the railway station yesterday, I went to the temple i used to go to every Tuesday with my mom. Felt good. Vultures are coming back. just saw 2 yesterday. such awesome birdies  Killer idea OP hope this becomes a thing (or a future website in which case HMU!)

A few days ago, my neighbour's plot caught fire. I thought it was intentionally done to clear the overgrowth. Such huge flames. I was cursing the mentality we have to use fire to clear our fields.

Later, I found out that the fire was accidental. However, the owner returned and found that since half the field was cleared, he might as well finish the job. Burned the rest off as well.

Supposedly, it's good for the soil and the ash can help the trees. What, 11 bucks for 1KG tomatoes? Its 20 bucks here.

And not getting enough sleep, a family function this weekend so too busy I saw this and I like it. Quite relaxing to hear the small stuff that affects people. Puts into perspective the damage social media, 24x7 news, FOMO has done to us. A part of this world moves at lightning speed and another part moves leisurely. 1. Today, I finished my first ever new york times crossword after months and months of trying to do them. It was one of the greatest feelings and i celebrated by eating a vanilla ice cream. Had not had ice creams for ages before today afternoon.

2. There is a stray cat which roams around my building. I stay on the 5th floor. She comes up daily and just stares at me while i cook and clean. I want to adopt it but I am not entirely sure its a stray.

3. Yesterday, i saw house sparrows after A LONG LONG time. Decided to keep some grains of rice on my balcony. They have not noticed it yet. Hopefully, tomorrow. *Yesterday, I wanked all by myself...* Yesterday I learnt that my roommate has been a headache ever since and my flatmates actually want her out. 

I don't want to be a part of their petty war and it's been only 3 days since I moved out.

:/ Electricity department replaced a damaged light pole that was in middle of the street. The entire activity took about 3 hours with about 12 15 onlookers with special interest.

1. Visited Delhi for the first time. I've been to Delhi before but my time has always been spent either in the Metro or places close to the railway station.

2. Realized that a lot of the shops I used to eat at when I was a kid have been trying to modernize and have lost the old touch. I wanted to show off this old school shop where they made a big mug of lassi in a kulhad to my SO. However, the lassi doesn't taste the same anymore. Felt bad because it was an experience that I wanted to share but couldn't and that shop was a big part of my city experience growing up. My dad's phone got stolen some assholes snatch it off his hand. They were on a bike. Feelsbadman.

Some tips:

 -You need 1g /kg body weight of protein to keep you fit everyday. So if your weight is 70kg eat 70g of protein everyday. 1 egg contains 6g of protein. If you're trying to lose weight, egg white : egg yolk ratio should be 2:1.
Soya beans , sprouts and lentils are good sources of protein. 


- Count your calories. If you're trying to loose weight eat less than your daily RDA. Google Indian RDA to check what's yours according to your weight. Approx. 2400 for males and 2000 for females. It's not rocket science , once you start counting and managing it'll become easier. 


-  Exercise? 

 I do warm up first followed by

 500 skips (60fast 40slow)

 70 burpees

 100 push ups 

They can be divided in sets of 3

 Abs workout

 
 And individual group of muscles (chest, back , shoulders etc)


- If you swim after that it's a bonus.

Try reading about High Intensity Interval training. 

- Drink lots of water and cut off sugar. Eat stuff like watermoln and cucumber it's low calorie, high fibre and keeps you hydrated. 


- Do something that makes you feel relaxed for me it's Swimming and Mediation (highly recommended, you should be fit mentally and physically)

Have patience it'll take atleast 3 months for you to notice chages. 

 If you just want to lose weight, don't exercise.
Just create a calorie deficit by eating less and moving more. (Moving includes regular walking and general activity)

If you want to get fit and build your body, you should take more protein, less carbs and workout more. Doing this will increase your hunger and appetite. So if you stop working out midway, there's a chance of gaining more weight and fat. 

So workout only if you can commit to your plan. Or else just eat less and create a calorie deficit to lose weight.  hit gym regularly. Initially you gain weight. But if you are regular you would tone up. Results will keep you going afterwards. 

Don’t diet, eat regular meals. reduce the quantity of carbohydrates (chapathi,rice) increase quantity of the sides (veg,meat) as much. eat seasonal fruits nothing fancy. 

drink water.


keep going!! Was never fat, cycle most days a week, play with a sponge ball in the terrace alone at night because I'm a loser, and that's how I keep my weight in check I walk 10k steps early in the morning in a nearby park. 

My weight has gone from 107.8kg to 96.4 kg in 3 months. My goal right now is to hit 70kg.

I count the calories in my food and ensure that there's a calorie deficit. I eat anything but stay within my calorie limit. For more info go to /r/loseit.  Right now I'm so unhealthy that if I keep it up I wont make it to 30 \^\^\^\^\^\^helpme **Exercise Routine**

Monday/Wednesday/Friday = bodyweight workouts sourced from the Recommended Routine from r/bodyweightfitness

Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday = different running workouts, between 3.5 and 10km incorporating sprints, fartlek running, easy runs etc.

I mix in yoga whenever I can remember to do some, and will sub in things like football, rock-climbing/bouldering etc whenever I can get a good group of friends together to go for this stuff.

I also make it a hard rule to always walk to where I'm going if it's a distance of less than 2.5km.

**Diet**

I don't follow a diet at all, beyond basic moderation. Try to stick to unprocessed food, but don't break my head over it. I enjoy cooking and baking and eating out wayyyy too much to let it stress me out; I do make sure I get at least 5 helpings of fruits/veggies a day, and eat a lot less rice. It also helps that I hardly ever drink (once in 6 months), and don't smoke.

**Short and Long-Term Fitness Goals**

Short-Term: maintain regularity (I've been working out using the above template for about 2.5 years now).

Long-Term: Achieve some of the more hardcore calisthenic movements/holds (human flags, iron cross, front lever, etc).

**Motivation**

My main motivations are to find an outlet for my stress/anxiety, and to maintain some level of control over my health.

I've always had issues with stress and anxiety, to the point of panic attacks, but working out (in conjunction with therapy) has helped that out a *lot* so knowing that helps me stay motivated whenever I feel like slacking off. 

Exercise to me is just a means to an end, the end being a motivated and healthy body with enough energy to help me get through the rest of my day/deal with my other life goals. So i'm not too fussed about perfecting my physique or going HAM on my diet. Accepting that has helped me be at peace with the fact that I might not be progressing nearly as fast as some of my friends who are more focused/dedicated. Exercise routine is to go to the gym 5 days a week for about 45 mins, each day for a separate body part. I start with legs and get it out of the way because its the most strenuous of the lot. Then I move on to chest, shoulders, back, arms.  


Short term fitness goal is actually to feel happy, I go for the dopamine rush more than anything. Long term, I hope to get away from being skinny fat to toning up a bit, nothing too extravagant  


Diet: I just don't keep eating till I'm full, and don't eat junk often. That should be more than enough for maintaining decent fitness. People recommending fancy diets have outlandish goals as well, I have no such plans.  


Achievement: Clothes fit better, I don't look like a scrawny teenager anymore, and I feel more confident in general. I’ve been following the r/nSuns program the last few months, and have experienced great results. 

I’ve also been keeping track of my diet, and overall, feel fitter and stronger by the day.  I mostly just do jogging after waking up and then some hanging exercises on the hanging bar followed by 50 pushups and 50 squats.  Guys Get a mi scale. This gives a wake up call to you. My body fat and Visceral levels are way above. We always have a positive self -image pg our bodies. 

The readings make me more aware of the food I am consuming . 
 Routine: 5/3/1 Boring but big, T-Nation challenge  https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/boring-but-big-3-month-challenge

So I don’t do the accessories there, only the main lifts. I accessorise using metallicadpa PPL with the pull lifts on Bench and OHP day, and push lifts on the active rest days with legs on the deadlift and squat day. 

Cardio 20 minutes on bench and ohp day, 30 minutes on ActiveRest and no cardio on leg day. 

Diet: I am currently eating around 2300kcal since I’m cutting. I go upto 3200 while bulking. My minimum aim is 200gms of protein. Eat 1kg chicken everyday, bulking or cutting. No whey or protein powders. Do take creatine and citrulline.Lots and lot of veggies, wheat bran for fibre. Sometimes I’ll do keto, so I’ll eat cauliflower otherwise it’s always rice (just convenient to cook and pack). 

Goals: Strength, strength and strength. Currently my stats are 192/160/105kgs on deadlift/squat/bench. Aim for end of year is 230/200/150 while keeping my weight same. Currently around 80kgs body weight at approx 16% body fat. Want to reach 12% at same weight (or maybe 2kgs lesser).

 I know a lot of people are asking you to eat healthy and control diet, but in India, that's next to impossible. The average meals at home/hostel/hotel are really lacking in nutrition, as they're mostly carbs.

And it should be yesterday because you've been through it and it's fresh in mind. I'll go first.

1. Yesterday I saw three donkeys after a very long time. I used to see and hear them almost everywhere. They've become a rare sight while I am growing up. They look old and don't look like they are in a good shape.
2. Yesterday I thought for few minutes why wasn't I am seeing monkeys in my neighborhood? They used to be everywhere in my childhood. That once again reminded me of a video made by one History professor on Pigeons in US. In early 19^th century 
2. Yesterday I watched a video on retrograde motion of Mars ~~mercury (and also sun)~~ again after a very long time. This time around I really wondered what it takes to observe such a motion. 

    a. First, curiosity of what's out there in the space; instead of just ignoring because it's been always there and can be seen everyday.

    b. Keep seeing one specific part of space, notice a specific object in the sky

    c. Identify the same object the next day

    d. Notice that that specific object has shifted it's position in fucking space and not a coordinate plane.  mean, you've got to have much more than a photographic memory to keep track of location of an object in space

   e. This comes before (d). The idea that I should keep track of it's location when you never knew it could move around/rotate/revolve.

    f. And the notice that the movement is strange. How many of us (in India) would do this in 21^st century? Apparently, this was observed by Greeks back in ~ 200 BC.
   
4. One auntie got mad at her husband/children and was screaming and shouting in no particular direction for a long time, even after they're gone. It seemed to stop at lunch time
5. I thought I should try making dosa using Chik Peas (Channa?) Yesterday I made batter and today morning I tried making dosas. It was a disaster. Was able to make just one dosa and it did taste dammed good. I am trying to make idli with the rest of the batter. It's work in progress.

84,AskIndia,"South India is not a monolithic culture. 



Within TN post independence rationalist, and Tamil movements took root allowing little space for Hindutva politics of RSS or Hindu Mahasabha. Even congress's influence waned  after Kamaraj. DMK continued to propagate athiestic world view( unless electorally inconvenient) whereas AIADMK has always been ambivalent about religion. JJ was never overly athiestic. 

As rationalist politics and Tamil  pride politics got run  over by caste politics and welfare measures
, there are some pockets especially in the upper caste who want to wear their religion on their sleeves, and have also felt marginalized these many decades. Remember these were the 'villains'  in the Periyar and Anti caste movements. This minority is now turning towards hindutva.

 AIADMK becoming a BJP puppet, and  BJP's vast spending on PR and social media lends greater visibility as well.



Kerala is surprisingly conservative as a society. BJP has managed to infest a few pockets, and has piggy backed on the Sabarimala issue (after initially supporting entry of women). They have had  nearly no impact on electoral politics till now though.



Karnataka is the only state where BJP has been able to form a govt. 

Thing to note here is that unlike other southern states Karnataka was not administered as a single entity pre independence. Karnataka today is an amalgamation of Mysore kingdom, North Karnataka ( part of Bombay province) and other parts of Madras presidency. Though a common language and past empires ( Hoysala, Satavahana , Vijayanagar etc) united the territories within the state, a cohesive state consciousness and politics is yet to emerge in my opinion.  

Different parts of Karnataka have thier political heavyweights. Mysore region dominated by JD(S) with Congress second. NK Congress. Coastal Karnataka and Malnad is where BJP is strongest. In fact coastal areas have suffered from the poison of hatred filled saffron cultural goondaism ( remember Sri Ram Sene and the pink chaddi movement? ). 

Although there have been rationalist movements in the past, and rationalist literature has seen its hey  day, hindutva's appeal is mainly political except for pockets mentioned earlier. 

I have no clue about AP and TN Mainly because they only resonate with the ""Hindu"" part. To them Modi, RSS and bjp stand for ""Hindutva"" or ""Hinduism"" . Also a lot of the supporters mostly belong to upper caste Brahmins who feel Rss and BJP alone are a party worth voting for (never mind how they are actually treated) and see Congress as a ""non hindu/Muslim party"". [deleted] In South it's usually the upper castes who have this North culture(Hindi Sanskrit and cow) worshipping nature. For them native culture of their land is not their culture. If you ask some Tamil brahmins they will claim sanskrit is their mother tongue.

This also explains why Marathi brahmins have historically been pro Hindi and running the RSS instead of sticking to Marathi language.

How much this narrative affects the state politics is function of their population and influence.
That explains the clear irrelevance of this hindi-hindu ideology in TN and it's significance elsewhere  I think it's just hatred towards Muslims that drives them to RSS/hindutva.  Everyone votes based on caste lines. Even the upper caste people. Who will have a higher representation on social media.  [deleted] 1. Conversions and Other religions: By making them the strawmen.
2. Positive Image: Because they are projecting themselves as representatives/guardians of Hinduism. 
3. About Hindi: Local RSS functions in the local language but the love for Hindi comes from believing that English is not good for their culture. English education is how one becomes ""westernised"". They paint English as the destructive force. Gandhi kinda comes off as racist and undoubtedly casteist. He is a bad marker of moral behvaiour tbh.  [deleted] Wow, slow clap OP!

This discussion is petty at best. If anything, the RSS wants a United India, not a country further squabbling about who's from the North and what language they speak of. Nobody is imposing Hindi on South India, other than the imagination of people who are inherently racist. Believing that someone else is a racist makes the person a racist too. [removed] ""And the fact that many of the RSS leaders believed(still believe?) in Aryan/Dravidan dichotomy just cements this idea. I just don't see them being anymore inclusive towards South India""

Out of the loop on this. What has RSS said on Aryan/dravidian divide? Any references.  Faith and Country are two distinct things. History between the two religions has been pretty rough. One of them got the rough deal while the other got away easy and is now playing the victim. So this misappropriation will make every Hindu latch onto any organization that voices its support for them.  It's the TV. TV should have the same sort of warnings as on cigarette packs. A lot of southie right wing supporters are very badly educated if you look at it, the rest are clever and want to capitalize on a situation and extract some sort of political power from this stupidity.

it's weird that people show fright when they watch horror movies or when some mob gathers to beat them but the way they go about living each day of their lives doesn't show they care much about taking care of themselves. (i've seen this hold especially true in ""macho men"" and less in women.) [removed] Activists only care for issues while the issues themselves are unpopular or not talked about.  Because they get off on the feeling of being the only ones fighting for it.

They throw protests with 12 people at cafes nobody visits and then complain that society doesn't take the issue seriously.

The moment their issues get momentum from the masses, they find some reason to criticize the movement and stay out of them. When someone popular takes up an issue (like an actor who has 10000x more reach than any activist) or when it becomes a hashtag with millions of people taking part, they won't try use this momentum to strengthen the movement. They'll just belittle it and write long think pieces about how the public/personality is missing the point or how everyone else is wrong and how they and they alone understand the true nuance of the situation.

When the Nirbhaya movement saw massive crowds form across the country, I noticed so many ""feminist"" activists stay out of it because it was a middle-class protest and because ""where were you"" when previous rapes had happened. They criticized the movement instead of adding to it.

I've noticed this happen so many times on so many different issues that I've given up thinking it's limited to just one branch of social activism. My generalization is that activists hate when the people actually take up their issue, because they no longer feel like its ""their"" issue. > Parents are always right.

PS: I am not an IITian. Talking from experience at workplace. Civic sense in India is very poor I used to work in an office with 75% females. My female colleagues and friends who had children were so overworked, stressed, miserable that it left an impression on my mind. (This was a great company to work for,  they had flexible work hours and WFH options for moms). I would not want my wife to go through that. I am not the kind who would ever stop my partner from pursuing her dreams and career, but I want to make sure that I can earn enough and provide a good life for my family on my own.

Most of my friends think I am silly for refusing the extra income, but at what cost? I'd rather prefer if my wife stayed home and raised my kids than busting her ass for a few lakhs more per year.

* Kids driving superbikes are maniacs and I won't shed a tear if their rash driving ends up killing them. Especially when they don't wear helmets. 

* Fuck Royal Enfield. If your dick is small, don't try to compensate by riding a noisy bike.

* Every five years, just vote out whoever is in power. Both Congress and BJP will fuck things up - it's best not to let them have two terms consecutively. 

* Old people should learn to shut the fuck up when it comes to the younger generation. You raised us. We have to deal with the problems you created or couldn't solve. So after a point, you really need to shut the fuck up since your chance is passed.

* If you disagree with something, downvoting doesn't change my mind. Use your words. [removed] [deleted] 1. Those who complain that others are X Y Z are basically talking about themselves. I am yet to meet an open minded person who keeps criticizing others non stop. Sure they will talk shit one day or another but not 24 x 7.

2. ""Feminism"" in India is different from actual Feminism started as suffrage movement by Ms Pankhurst. Feminism means I wont disrespect a woman's opinion just because she is a woman.

3. Men and women need to understand the differences in the gender. Men need to realise that women have their own brain and self respect. Not all need constant pampering and looking down upon. That you are equally responsible for your household. Only girls r not responsible.

4. Generally ppl don't complain for things until it starts affecting themselves.

I find it baffling to see a lot of South Indians on Social Media vociferously supporting RSS. In a Hindi-Hindu Rastra they are ethnic minorities with second class status. And the fact that many of the RSS leaders believed(still believe?) in Aryan/Dravidan dichotomy just cements this idea. I just don't see them being anymore inclusive towards South India than they are towards non-Hindus. Which begs the question, why is there even a single South Indian Bhakt?

 Cordless vacuum cleaner. Cleaning house is so much easier, and now house gets cleaned more often. I was putting off buying a microwave for years. It has been life changing since I got it.

An electric shaver/trimmer by Philips. Got it for like 700 something during some promotion. Used to have a lot of skin problems that now I know to be due to my earlier means of shaving (razor/cartridge style blades). Sure, they don't give a close shave but it is good enough and does not cause a lot of skin problems that may happen when you use a blade of any kind on skin.

Not one, but almost any high quality item I have purchased has served me really, really well. In contrast, whenever I've saved money on things, they ended up either requiring a lot of repairs or downright upgrading quicker than I thought. Here are a few top picks:

1. Memory foam mattress (significantly improves sleep)
2. High end running shoes from Decathlon (reduce strain on your ankles, don't skimp on shoes!)
3. A 27"" 4K monitor (Man, this thing is amazing to watch movies and youtube on, as well as general browsing and coding. If you are using a laptop, seriously consider attaching it to a monitor and getting wireless keyboard and mouse)
4. A gearless scooter in Bangalore: Here, public transport is non-existent, Uber is too slow/expensive and auto guys fleece you hard. Scooter will easily run you down 8000-10000 km a year and if you think of 20 rupees per km for Uber(standard in Bangalore), it justifies the cost of scooter + fuel in less than a year. Also, gearless is much easier to drive in city traffic.

In contrast, the cheap chair I bought gives me back pains after long sessions(trying to get rid of it at a loss :( ), the 8 years old second hand fridge required several repairs, and the cheap laptop I bought gave me heating issues and horrible battery life. I have learned my lesson that good stuff lasts longer and pays for itself in that time. Amazon Alexa along with a few connected lights. Very convenient to have it all synced up. Also, if you cook a fair bit or just enjoy cooking, get a good quality knife or 2. Makes cooking so much nicer.

 Chromecast is great. Purchasing dashcam also makes me feel safe while driving. Chromecast... really dont wanna see anything in a small phone screen now.  A good quality mattress with pillow that suits your body.

No amount of exercise and yoga can help your body if your mattress and pillow are not comfortable(doesn't always need to be soft). You spend most of your life of bed(average 6+ hours) so compromising with it is not a good idea.

91,AskIndia,"There's really no way to answer your question. Some people  would tell you to join your father's company because they'd hate working for others. Others would recommend MBA since the financial security that comes with it is important to them (MBA grads can shift from one industry to another without significant loss in pay and hence can manage well during troubling economy and downturn in specific industries). People will answer with their personal biases.

For both the options, there's pretty much the same risks and payoffs involved. You can do mba, fail to get a good job, and then struggle to pay the loan, OR you can get a great placement in big firm and be set for life with steadily growing pay and job security. If you choose your father's company, you'd become like Bezos, or you'd end up bankrupt. There's no way anyone can predict what will happen. 

This is actually the sort of decision that you will need to decide for yourself after considering both financial aspects as well as whether you'd enjoy working in either of the two streams. if you don't mind, as a potential MBA aspirant, I'd like to ask you a couple of a questions. can i comment/dm? I would rather be paying 1.6Lpm than earning it.  There are multiple options you could explore. For instance, join your dad’s firm, explore relevant certifications ( you said project management so I’m guessing a PMP, PSM or ITIL would be relevant), build up experience and then explore a full time or executive mba a few years down the line. As I’m sure you know an mba is more to do with building key business skills rather than learning about finance or marketing topics. Plus whenever you take over your dad’s business a full time an MBA would also add credibility to your CV if you were to seek funding or scout for clients; and also use the alumni network for the same. 

Again- this is just one suggested approach.  >Dad's company = My company

Are you sure? How much authority or power will you get after joining your dad's company? Consider all these before making your decision.

I know a guy who decided to join his father's business after engineering. Later he discovered that he didn't actually had much authority because the dad was controlling everything.

I enjoy the consultancy bit, and the engineering part, but it doesn't pay as well as a Top MBA job would. So now I am confused, primarily because :
1. Dad's company = My company, plus staying at home (I've had loneliness induced anxiety before)  is a big thing.
2. MBA has a huge loan attached (25L+interest) which I need a lot of time to pay off.
3. Even if I stay home, I'll have to get some specialization in my field of engineering. So more padhai, along with work.
4. I can always work and make the consultancy bigger, expand it.

Young educated Indians are facing a drastic mental pressure as soon as they're done with their studies.

And, Indian society is very structured and surprisingly united in holding on to its dogmas. While young people are still figuring out what's on their mind, they're buried under the societal shit of finding a 'suitable' job, marriage, giving their parents grandkids to play with, buying a vehicle, buying a house, etc. And before they'd realize what's on their mind, most of them would be no longer young.

Some young people cannot take it, they break away and become recluse. A few others, desperate to prove themselves to the society, follow mobs, become vandals and cause chaos. But most just suck it up. They learn to live with it. They grow up to either quell the dogmas or propagate them further. I only hope the former triumphs.

I'm sorry if that sounded depressing. I'd be happy if someone could change my mind. I have 0 friends for 3 years, no collage, coaching or job... 0 interaction with anyone except my family, go out once a week... 

Damn! Seems like have Hikikomori for 3 years... I've seen and studied cases where people get into that phase many a times because of medical reasons (like disorders and infectious disease). But it's sad how people become socially withdrawn because of external reasons like a bad breakup, loss of loved one and circumstances of situation. All it needs is a few words from those who care and give support throughout. 

**Solitude** is a state of isolation that is temporary. Like suddenly trying to stay home for a whole week binge watching series and not facing the sun. Some people end up there because of many reasons, and they've been through a lot of shit. Some fall in never to get up and feeling comfortable in a hole because its far better than the shitshow happening outside it. Our education is taking pride in making products (like engineers with MS and MBA in foreign Universities), judging on how much you earn and how rick you look. Nothing else. They have a very stupid yardstick just for judging. Help another guy? Fuck it. 

For dumb people who blame the internet for this, this is the ONLY safe space for many people. Unfortunately, those boxed up isolation chambers contains many hidden gems. There are thousands of Amazing DJs, Great artists, kick-ass gamers who feel its better to be anonymous, chatting with random persons across the globe rather than their own family, because the family is afraid of the society, the shameless society whose only wish is to screw others for fun. This might take generations to recover. But it will.

On a rather real note don't be afraid to open up, especially when you are alone. Ofc there are dumbfucks who might take advantage of it or even use you throughout. Learn your lessons. You'll end up with a few who'll hope for your betterment...Always. There's always people who would find it fun to talk to you and support you. I can be one if you wouldn't mind. My inbox is always open. Stay safe.

&#x200B; A big difference between Japan and India is that Japan is a 1st world country and most people can afford to keep their kids at home doing nothing without a significant change in their lifestyle.

In India, most people can not afford to support an adult without any benefits and parental push or hunger would force a person to work (or become a destitute).

However, in middle and upper middle-class households, I won't be surprised with a rise of Hikkikomori lifestyle. [deleted] [removed] Yes, shitty private college engineering. Holy Shit! Iam one of them. It has made a landfall on our large shitholes (metros) where traffic is where we see outside world (filled with strangers) and mobile is where we socialize. This daily routine coupled with work/studies/family pressure can make even a sane logical thinking person who sees no meaningful outcome with social interactions other than for greed and power go into social isolation. 
India with its growing middle class will be a Hikikomori warehouse in the near future.  Oh god YES!

I've been wanting to make a post like this for a long time. As a 22-year-old, I was probably part of the last generation (in India at least) of kids who spent most of their childhood outside playing/socializing than on digital screens.

I agree with your post, we absolutely have an invisible problem lurking just below the surface of our false outer facade of the 'demographic dividend' potential. We have an insane number of young people, with a super narrow set of opportunities, who're growing up in a culture that absolutely sucks at socializing, dating, and having conversations and [connection with even the fucking neighbors.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/indians-in-gated-communities-meet-their-neighbors-online/2012/06/12/gJQAvjPfWV_story.html)

With the spread of the internet (not blaming it, it just catalyzes the worst aspects of the problem), I only see this problem getting worse. Most kids are growing up alone with barely any social skills, and without proper intervention, they'll go on to have terrible lives as adults, and as you noted -- die a lonely death.



 Add me. It's been two years.  Most married women in lower middle class...  [deleted] I live in Japan now and back in 2012-2013 I spent a good six months confined to my room at my parents house in India. I wasn’t unemployed though (I worked remotely), simply tired of people and the mundane routine that was my life. 

I know a few of my friends (in India) who quit their high paying jobs and decided to backpack across the country and live as a free spirit. (they don’t use cellphones). 

We all have our own coping mechanism to deal with life as we know it (mine was gaming and traveling around the world). 引きこもり is just one such way. Its not because of over work it could be anything that causes a person to believe life inside four walls is a better life. Some Hikikomori do work remotely. There are several manga artists, singers, and even developers I know who are Hikikomori but with a profession.  They’ll refuse to make public appearances or do video calls but happily work and text. 

Think of Hikikomori as someone on a house arrest but voluntarily. The house for them is a safe zone (psychologically speaking) where no harm would come to them both physically and mentally. 

You should watch https://youtu.be/wE1UIK85E3E which is a more accurate description of what it is than return to NHK. 

I also recommend these anime “No Game No Life”, “Eromanga sensei” and “re:Life” if you want to explore Hikikomori via anime subculture. 

Feel free to ask me anything you wish to know.  One category everyone of you missed - **unmarried, unemployed women** who have aged beyond what is commonly considered marrying age. Another category is divorced women. These two have existed in Indian culture since time immemorial. I know a few people in these categories. The fear of a girl entering this category is the main reason Indian relatives/parents pressurize girls to get married as soon as possible. Yeah I was one in my early to mid 20s. I only got out because of support of my parents. Though even now I feel detached from the narrow focus of the society around me, and often times struggle with motivation. The only thing that's constant for me is my love of my chosen field. I think it's happening. Not the exact phenomenon but we do have an Indian version of it. 

IT employees in metro cities and IAS aspirants are somewhat the same. It happens very slowly, most them don't even realize this; only after some mid-life crisis hits them. 

But as always, they are not to be blamed. They are the result of a broken system and societal pressures. The day is not far away, when we will see some of them call it quits and move to their native place again or look for a different career option. Despite the so called inclusive society, high levels of social isolation is very common in urban areas.

Nice post btw. For those of us reading from outside India, could you please explain what IAS is? 
Aside from that I think you've made a very well  articulated argument and although I only have a basic understanding of Indian social dynamics, I have spent a good amount of time in Japan and I can potentially see some similarities in the results although I believe the reasons are quite different. In India, the assurance of family support might be the cause despite people having genuine ambition (such as the the friend you've cited), whereas in Japan there seems to be a growing lack of ambition from the get-go. Young people are losing the desire to compete in society, possible for fear of failure. There is also a term for this in Japanese which translates along the lines of ""plant-eating boy"" and refers those young men who would rather stay home than take any risks at all (while being primarily used in the context of dating).  Yes. Mostly because of 2 reasons, the job market is fucked. So parents pressure kids into doing things they have no interest in and in the end it all goes wrong.

Now why is the job market fucked? Pretty sure there are jobs? Correct. The problem is not that there are no jobs. Let's explain with example.

A kid is provided with everything from phone to house to car because his or her parents worked hard and reached the level they are at. Now, the market is so screwed, a person on employment cannot build a decent house in a good area all his/her life. Kids are under pressure to achieve more than their parents because they assume ""my parents earned this, and it's not enough for me.. I gotta earn more"". So they are satisfied with jobs that pay less... but what parents dont usually tell their kids is that they also started with low paying jobs. My father started with 1200 rupees a month and earns 2 lakh a month now. Though it took all life. 

Kids expect they will start at 10 or 20k and then within 3 months it should double... dreams. And even if their parents tell them, they discard it by saying ""tab to sab kuch sata tha"". True it was cheap but their pay was low too? It's the same. 

So simply, these kids have had it all and dont think its necessary to earn because they wont enough for it to mean anything, so why not live on your parents money? And that is how they become shut-in.... that combined fear of judgement from society. 

Hope I could explain properly.  Social media also has it's share in contributing to the problem. It took me some time understanding how society and family influences your desires and what you want to pursue in life. Only a minority would achieve that kind of success early in life which would require talent, hardwork, motivation, ability to focus for long amounts of time and a bit of luck. When you disentangle from all those expectations, you feel light, you finally get to know yourself and what you want to pursue in life. You get to see your flaws in a non-judgemental way and start working on them at your own pace. 

Women's high dating standards in Japan also contributed to the problem. Most women there would prefer to stay single than to date/ marry a average looking/ earning guy. This resulted in men dropping from society. I can see this happening in our country in the very near future. No it will never happen in india in the same manner it happened in japan or not happened all together.

Our society is not made in a way to allow 'space' or too much personal  freedom That they can be separated from the society.  I never thought i would see a thread about being a Hikikomori in r/india but i would like to share my experience, so after i had given my ISC exam there was a long break in the duration before i appeared for JEE. So as usual during this time the pressure from my family to study to get a good collage was highest and also as i generally do not like to talk to people i got my full freedom to become a NEET like i didn't leave the floor i was on for 2 months and the experience was not very pleasant but liberating as I didn't have to face my family or so called friends.the duration of this was about 2-4 months but then collage happened and now i am rehabilitating into the society i still hate people and do not talk much but at least i am not a shut in now.  Pubground I stay indoors and enjoy my time alone.  Yep I do think Hikikomori is a thing in our country. I've been unemployed for a while now and the materialization of my ambitions hasn't happened yet, I'm studying hard and have confidence in myself but still I try to avoid socializing as much as possible, it just doesn't feel worth it. Exercising, junk food, netflix and studies is all I do and yet I do not feel as depressed as I should because even without achieving anything that matters in the real world, I have somehow accepted the fact that one day I will make something of myself. But I do fear the what-if scenarios where I couldn't do what I set out to do. The fear of failures is strong and we try to keep that fear locked in a box but the society keeps reminding you of that fear.  Now Hear my story I am a 25 year old  now, lets start when i was 18 year old, I was  a   ""Bindass type"" Guy but surrounded by wrong group of friends which they cheated on me thinking i am a ""Chutiya"", Friends used to take advantage of me so I liked a Girl but couldn't approach her and tell  that I like her but i didn't had that strength wasted 5 years of my life in that phase she went to Kerala for her medical career  and i left NIIT career course in mid way so couldn't complete it, was depressed and got lazy spending most of the time on the internet and playing video games,some times i had suicidal  thoughts but then i overcame it thinking its all a temporary feeling, I wanted to be a software developer after bcom completion in 2015 but i didn't had that motivational strength to do it and then i joined a company in 2016 and left it after 5 months due to pressure from seniors and for a period of 1 year i was mentally disturbed then in 2017 i joined a call center bpo worked for 5 months due to low salary and drug addicts and wrong crowd,i left the company on lunch break and for a period of 6 months i wasted  wandering what to do i wanted to go into software development but some astrologer told me that i will not have a career on technical field so didn't had that much motivation to do,later i went to  Kerala for a mid vacation and then  got a call from Accenture stating they wanna  hire me so i went for the interview in Mumbai for BPO process Insurance again not part of my interest and lot of pressure spent 8 months of working and later I Left it, then i watched a Documentry on Youtube of Hikkikomori people then i got to know thats what i am going through My career is totally fucked and crumbled now  i am fighting against my lethargy and trying all the best i can to get into Software development field. An insightful post after a long time on r/India. Thanks for sharing. A friend of mine recently went NEET after quitting her stressful job. She got a job offer, but didn't take it up because it was 'too far' (basically 90 min away).

And she hasn't stopped talking to me too. I often wonder what she does all day.  Too poor for that shit. Most men in India can't afford to sit only at home. They need to get out and work to get food. >many millions will, statistically, die alone.

Most people die alone. I don't know if it counts as half Hikikomori, but when I'm in engineering all I did is go to college and come to home. Sometimes I even didn't go to college for few weeks and stayed at home. 

I'm doing a job now. But it's same, office, home, zero interaction. 

I want to get rid of this habit but well still can't.  I came across this a while ago and quickly realized it is not just a Japanese phenomenon because I was able to relate to it so much. I quit three well paying jobs in past two years to stay at home and try to earn an income on my own, but haven't succeeded so far. Gave up soon and got a job the first two times, but now its been six months since I've been at home after quitting my last job. If only I can make a living by staying at home, I'll be a Hikikomori for life! :P Bro Idk what to do  Ive been a recluse myself for over 5 years.  Nah, Hakikomori completely different to what's happening in India. Indian job aspirants experience social isolation but they still have minimal interaction and goals, but it's nothing like being a NEET. Hikikomori is way too severe, like 5 years at average. Minimum 2 years to even consider yourself to be one. Also, there's Neetbux and money from their parents even at the age of 25-30, they also don't have any goals other than self pleasure, Indian parents rarely raise a 30 year old child. Hikikomori rarely get get out to the point that Agoraphobia. You can't compare Hikikomori to Indian isolation. Dont think Indian parents will let it get that bad. Take Indian social isolation and multiply it by 8000 times, then you get a hikikomori. Perhaps it had to do with the current job scenario in our country or may be not but I think it's a reflection of the educational system that focused too much on irrelevant things like IITJEE or leaving no other choice for students than Btech and such. Sad thing still being that parents are unable to accept the fact that engineering and related streams are saturated and its not a decision to be made by parents but rather its the teenager who should be capable enough to take a decision on their own.

And the work culture in India is starting to improve, at least in the IT world, with the start-ups popping up but it's gonna take a long time for those stubborn corporations to adapt to a better work environment.  It's very difficult to be a *hikikomori* in India because there are so many people and everybody wants to have something to do with you. Contrary to what you are saying, it's almost impossible to be forgotten because somebody will always ask about you or if they haven't seen you for a long time will just ask straight where you've been and what you're doing. Social isolation is probably the most difficult thing to achieve here. Being socially isolated assumes an individualist society which we haven't been able to build yet. For, me I am kind of a social recluse. But, not as bad as a Hikikomori as I have a job and I still go out to tea with my gang. I am trying to improve. Well done OP on putting forward a topic which is prevalent but isn't talked about much. It's just like several other problems which aren't considered as ""real"" problems in India. I feel it'll be a long time before Indians try solving it. They first need to recognize it as a problem.  Contrary to popular belief here, I think that the Indian culture that is rooted into me won't permit me to become a complete shut in not matter how low I fall. There is the added fear that parents would stop supporting altogether, not to mention the society pressure of doing something productive.

I do however agree that male loneliness is very much on the rise, but don't think that it will progress to the point where a considerable amount of people would become hikkis

",1545222998.0,1,131,0,269,"Hikikomori is a social phenomenon observed in Japan. It's a case of social withdrawal, where young people just stay indoors for years and years. They don't go out, or work (becoming NEETS - Not in Education, Employment, or Training), or socialize IRL. Their whole lives just revolve around the apartments they stay in (some alone, some with their parents).

Their reasons can vary - fear of societal disappointment, anxiety, depression, heartbreak, etc. It has much to do with the work culture of Japan, with its insanely long working hours, high expectations, conformity, and rigid social rules. I'd suggest reading about [Hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori) and checking out some of the IAMAs done on it. And the anime, Welcome to the NHK.

Some of the factors that cause this are common here. Japan is very different from India so let's get past that bit. However, we do have similarities. Indians are [increasingly overworked](https://qz.com/india/1030594/indian-millennials-are-overworked-and-sick-of-office-politics/) with most of our workers [burning out](https://qz.com/india/1401250/indias-unhealthy-workforce-stands-in-the-way-of-economic-growth/) from unhealthy conditions. [Indians are lonely](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-04/india-obsession-with-sons-millions-of-lonely-men-after-dowry/7903134) and many millions will, statistically, die alone. This is not to count the actual problem that we have no dating culture in India, and the fact that most men are unlikely to be well-socialized with women - who then watch movies about romance and start to wonder why their lives don't match up with what's on screen. Indian male loneliness is crippling, and prevalent, in my opinion.

Like Japan, we also have strong family structures, so that an unemployed youth staying at home and slowly rotting away isn't uncommon. In fact, in Kerala, I would say every family has one. There are cousins and uncles - people who for unexplained reasons end up doing nothing but staying at home. We have people who strike out into depression after failing the IIT-JEEs and AIEEEs or back papers, who stay home and seldom if not never come out. I'm sure many have posted on this subreddit as well. 

**One strange parallel I feel we have with the Hikikomori is the IAS aspirant**. There is a degree of social isolation and staying-at-home-for-years that happens with both IAS aspirants and Hikikomori that really strikes me. OFC not all IAS aspirants are the same but I know one shut-in and one on his way to becoming one, perhaps. Anyway this is just my view.

What do you think, though? Are a lot of young Indians locking themselves away from society as well? Have you ever felt the urge? Any discussion appreciated. 

I write as someone who's been unemployed for a good year now and I can feel the yawning chasm of social reclusion approach. Most of my year was at home, though I took gaps to travel. This was more a recluse from my career than from socializing, though I do feel I've been meeting fewer new people than I normally do.

I do believe that his is happening, though quietly. In a country like ours, it's easy to be forgotten.",[AskIndia] Is Reddit blocked for anyone else in Assam on Jio?

96,AskIndia,"Not for all of them, but for many of the stars, their everyday language of thinking and communication is English.

Many of the movie scripts are written in English, with English dialogue, and later translated to Hindi.  most of them are star kids from rich families, elite social circles and attended schools where they hung around kids from other uber rich families so English is like their first language. there is no denying that the rich prefer English over Hindi. It's a language everyone can speak with a good level of fluency, most urban people in India are 80% Westernized so English is actually the most natural language for us, I'm sure you're talking about Koffee, it's on Star World which is an English channel.  Because English would be easy to understand compared the Hindi and it's slangs atleast in Interview . In the movie we have the context and even if somewords go over my head it is OK . Recent example GullyBoy . I am not a native Hindi speaker and I watch some interview's time to time on Film Companion& FC South( Youtube ) when they were asked why all their content is in English they mentioned the same thing making it English gives wide range of Audience . 

And the Fact that some of the South Actors are from north/Foreign and some of the North Actors are from South / Foreign . It makes sense to have the interview in the Language everyone is comfortable in . Just like Rule #3 of r/India



 A lot of actresses can't even speak proper Hindi. Also, a lot of actors are looked down upon if they are hindi speaking. Apparently, it's a sign of non-urban upbringing. 

Also, these actors have a lot of insecurities that gets covered by language! Why not? English is spoken all over. Not everyone speaks hindi, English is the common thread amongst all our languages. Fortunately most in Tamil industry sticks to Tamil.  If the interviewer asks the question in English, it'd look silly if answered in Hindi and vice versa.  
English channels and portals would have the interviews in English generally and Hindi ones in Hindi.  Exceptions do happen though.   The obvious trivial answer is that they're mostly more comfortable with English than Hindi - that the language of thought is English.

That's obviously because the ""better"" schools in India are English-medium.

But I find a little amusing the objection to that, and the vilification of those whose English is better than their Hindi.

It makes SENSE for English to be the primary language of education, and I think it's atrocious that students from vernacular medium schools can get through 12+ years of education without enough functional English to survive college.  The purpose of language is communication. And for better or worse, the world has adopted English as the international language of communication.  You might say it's largely due to historical reasons of empire, but English is also a very flexible language, able to adapt new vocabularies very rapidly.  

You might say Bollywood is the Hindi film industry, so they should speak Hindi. But then Bollywood is in Maharashtra,  so shouldn't it all be Marathi? 
Should South Indian actors and technicians be disallowed from participation in Bollywood? Or should they have a Hindi language qualification for entry?

In a country like India, it makes perfect sense to use the only common language that connects all regions.  And Indian English is a legitimate dialect in its own right - we are not using the language of Imperialists really.

By that token, Hindi is certainly not a natural language of even the so-called ""Hindi Belt"". Hindi is a synthetic language, specifically created to standardize a lingua franca for the northern regions.

Indian English does the same for the whole nation. People from South India follow the lives of these celebrities too. Speaking in Hindi would alienate an entire region. “Aaj mai kar ke aaya hai” Why do some of them talk in hindi?  Isn't India basically English speaking? I mean it's the de facto common language  Kahe ki speaking ingles makes you look educated and upmarket.

I feel the same situation will arise in home after I get a decent job given your mom and my mom's share similar traits.

Hope you find a good way to dissolve things, OP! Good luck! General advice: It may sound selfish . But then this is the time to be selfish. 10 years down the line you will be in their shoes and not young enough to follow your dreams.

Step 1: threaten to leave if they don’t mend their ways. 

Step 2: if they don’t change then actually leave. Take a job outside. Once you are gone they ll realise your importance. A little bit of distance helps. Unless they realise your importance they won’t hear you.

Step 3: move back and make them move with you once things are normal and you feel they are ready to listen and change.

There is no point wasting your life trying to convince them when in their eyes their ego is bigger than peace of family and your career. Same story at my house too. This problem isn't something that appeared one day, this problem existed long time back since you were a child. Now trying to change it won't help much. Maybe they'll understand you are not liking it and will stay silent in front of you. But once your back is turned, it will start again.

&#x200B;

For now, I suggest you stay at distance from them. Rent a house bit away or else buy one. Because whatever the matter is you shouldn't let daughter of someone else suffer it after marriage. Plus, it will give time to your parents to adjust to your absence rather than it suddenly happening after marriage.

&#x200B;

Regarding 5th point, I did it. Moved to Pune from Mumbai, refreshed life. Now I have my own place, I got married. My parents visit us once in awhile, we visit them once in a while. But I am sure my wife wouldn't have been able to survive them. It's not abandonment, you can always bring them to your home when age catches up and they actually need you. But till they are capable of handling themselves, let them do it. I can empathize with your parents. In most middle class Indian households, financial security is the biggest concern. I imagine your parents would have experienced some sort of financial strife in their life, which has made them this way.

So what to do? You have to ensure that you convey your respect to them. You volunteer to undertake some minor expenses... nay, you undertake some minor expenses like paying for cooking gas/groceries/telephone/internet etc. 

Keep pitching in, but also ensure that you have some sort of financial independence. Keep taking those trips with your friends... you're not obliged to take permission of your parents, but it's good to keep them informed.

 salary ctc hai ya net?

i had a friend in your situation, he set up a yoga center and put his parents in charge, now he makes money and his parents are busy with things they like to do and be in company of people of their age.  1. Find a job in another city and move out as soon as you can. You are not getting younger. You deserve to experience other things in life, this is not going to get better and you need time for other things. You can and should keep in touch with them 

2. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT, get married and live with your parents. Anywhere. Tell your wife about the situation and how you handle it and what she should ignore when things go south. Spend time in nurturing relationship with your wife. She should never feel that your parents control your actions. And they should not. 

3. Make sure your parents have resources in their old age, give sincere advice, be forceful while making logical arguments if needed, don't break relations, you can restrict the time you spend on them without making them feel helpless. Beyond that you don't need to do anything. Bhaad mein Gaye log kya kahenge. 

Be sincere to yourself and be confident.  Your parents might be doing this all the time because they might have nothing else to do. This may sound stupid but this happens all the time especially with retired people. You're now the man of the house. Act like you are. Talk to them firmly. Tell them if they don't stop arguing you will either move out, put them in a nursing home or in therapy. Tell them it's affecting you as well. 

Before doing this. 
Make sure you Go to Kesari, Veena world or Thomas cook with your parents. Show them the catalogs then let them choose. Make sure you take every aspect like weather conditions, clothing, no. Of days, etc. In consideration. Even after that they're not able to decide you decide it for them. If after the trip they don't change the behaviour then go for the first option. If possible,I would suggest trying to take your parents out of India. Somewhere not too costly like Singapore or Malaysia or even UAE. This way you and your father both can contribute. And make sure you go with them.  Hey Yellow, I think you already have answers to all your questions in your head but you need someone else to tell them to you. 


Well I hope this helps, I moved out of my house as soon as I got my current job, lived in same/different cities. Fast forward 6 years, right now living with wife and kid. Parents happy and content as we keep visiting them. Thankful to God ,my parents are not very fussy (old age problems yet to kick in) and keeping fit as of now.

Further,  I know it sounds very kiddish that,  there can be only one alpha male in the house, but it actually holds true specially with retired parents.

 Parents either one of them will not like you taking life decisions that too involving any kind of money and if they're not involved in decision making process they will feel and this will bug them continously. 

So be bold, make the move, take care. Control freak parents are the norm in India. If you are earning enough to take care of yourself and contribute to their well-being as well, then do as you please with your money.

Do try to spend it responsibly though, and one way is to invest a part of your income to support your long term needs. That way if theyfreak out or shame you for your expenditure, you have proof to make them STFU.

Oh, and you should stop being an intermediary when they fight. Things will eventually reach am equilibrium.

Also, just tell them that you are grown up, intend to take care of them when they are incapable, so they should not worry too much about money, within reason. Tell them to enjoy their post-retirement life doing some of the things they didn't while taking care of you.

If that does not work, tell them you will move out for your mental peace, if they can't resolve their differences like sensible adults. They have been together for 30 years and ought to know each other well by now. I am also the only child (son) and it sucks. The whole world is on your shoulders!!!  Send them for a short vacation or pilgrimage. This may sound stupid but they seem bored and worried thinking just about the future. Ask them if they really are debt free and don't have any hidden expense that they are worried about. One solution is to get one of them (the healthier one probably) something to do, like a cozy business. Doesn't need to be successful. Most people can't stand to be in close quarters with another 24x7. Especially those with arranged marriages and full time jobs.

It will be awkward to suggest though. You could phrase it like a favour to you, and the business could also be something you might want to grow down the line. One suggestion, I am not sure how it will be implemented but try to go to counselling first alone and then with parents. It helps to clear out your mind and chart a path for the future. But be aware it might give you answers which you didn't expect, but it helps. Upvoting for  visibility.  ",1550566426.0,1,43,0,66,"27/M/Mumbai/Single/Only Son. Working a decent corporate job. I make \~14LPA. My parents are now retired. I've lived with them my whole life.

&#x200B;

I've had a good upbringing but my main problem has been that throughout my life, my family has been a group of over-thinkers, which has caused anxiety in me (and I'm sure in them) over things like ""What will you do?"" ""What if this?"" ""What if that?"" in every social, career, relationship position possible.

&#x200B;

Till they were working, this was fine, but ever since they've retired, they are finding it tough to deal with such situations. They have a good networth, we own 3 properties (live in 1, rented 1), they have a good corpus in the bank and they've invested money in good mediums. We are debt free. They feel they will run out of money, inflation will eat them up, they won't have food in their old age etc. This leads to fights daily among my parents and I am in the middle of the it playing the referee. In their fights, they demean each other calling out each other's weaknesses and failed ambitions in life. I felt this would happen a few days after retirement, but it's almost been a year now and it's non-stop.

&#x200B;

I do contribute to the house here and there but I feel that it'll hurt my father's ego if I start paying for household expenses. My father restricts a lot of travel to other cities citing expenses. My mom tells me in her fits of anger to ""pay"" for her to travel to other cities. I have volunteered but never followed through cause they never decided to go anywhere. **Are they waiting for me to take initiative / is their ego stopping them from asking / will I hurt their ego by paying?**

My mom has to feel in control of the house. With the timings of the maid to the food brought into the house. Even on the ocassions that my parents are back in their village for a week or two  - it's non stop. She cannot let go of things. **Does she feel she will lose control of the house if I take care of things?**

&#x200B;

There's a fight every second week over something or the other and the parents are not on talking terms for days. They had one today morning as I came to office. **Is this normal?**

&#x200B;

Now, this is leading me to a situation where I am :

1. Worried to make any big spends of my own and having the independence to do so - be it a trip with my friends, maybe a property on my name etc. How do I tackle this when it comes up? I don't want to be in a situation where my mom is like ""we aren't taking that train trip but you are going on joytrips with your friends?""
2. If I get married and live with my parents (Which my mom pretty much expects me to) will this be a conducive situation to start off my married life?  Specially with their fighting and all. How do I draw the line and be clear without hurting their feelings?
3. Has anyone moved out of their parents' house with some level of resentment (before or after marriage) and kept good cordial terms with their parents?
4. I feel a bit burdened and tied down in my house cause of few of the things here and otherwise. I am not always the happiest person when I get back home and look forward to office even though it's dull at times. Is this normal?
5. I have thoughts of getting a new job in another city and moving there alone and starting afresh (easier to change cities than get another house in the city). Is this okay? Does this make me a horrible child for abandoning 60 year old parents at home after retirement?

But he lives in a house that costs a crore and a half, drives a car that costs close to a crore and has a bike that costs 20 lakhs!

And he's not an outlier, the dowry given over here are huge and its there everywhere. My mother's friends boast off about how their son got acres of land , houses and expensive watches in dowry. All their sons are average engineering folks from a tier 3 college working for an IT company. :3 Bhai do you have any idea how much guys get in dowry? Their whole life revolves around getting a good job so their family can extort good dowry from girl's family. They get inherited bunglows, cars, fridge, TV, washing machine, expensive gifts etc you name it, and this is out of compulsion. What your friend got was a gift, she didn't ask for it. This way, men are bigger gold diggers. Stop acting like the world owes you anything. Life isn't supposed to be served on a silver platter. You're making excuses for your own incompetence.

I'm not undermining what you are feeling by saying the last thing. Like I said, I feel the same way, but yeah. Life is unfair. Hi.

An ex of mine left me for a richer dude. It shattered me to pieces. I was devastated. There was no motivation for a good while. I was cutting myself ( I hate people who do it, it achieves nothing, just like suicide).

I know what you're going through.

I find solace in the fact that no one can point at me and say ' Baap ka paisa'. 

I made myself. You'll too.

123,Non-Political,"Isnt this a given thing at delhi metro stations now? Bas kar pagle,rulayega kya ? [deleted] All those people who are amused by it this is what happens when you give them some infrastructure.  

With Air conditioned trains the doors are closed and open only when the train actually stops.  So you have to wait anyway. 

With other locals I have seen even auntys  board the train before it actually stops so that they can grab a seat.  No way they will wait for the train to stop because some other aunty would have grabbed the seat by then. 

Now if you really want to ensure people queue up start installing platform screening doors.  But that's expensive and I don't have any expectations from Indian railways.   Fake fake fake! OP paid the people to stand in a line! Only if this was followed for every other train too, every morning is a fight to get into a Churchgate bound train Wtf is happening? In which alternate universe is this borivali station located? Propaganda. Next thing you know they will tell that first people will be allowed to get off the train and then people will board the train. Nonsense. Wonder how this happened? Was there constant messaging to nudge people to do this? How did you manage to travel to a parallel universe? History time. When I was growing up in Mumbai in  late '80s every bus stop south of Sion used to have an orderly line to board the bus. It was very similar to this [video](https://youtu.be/ats8Y1yzgPI?t=182). Somehow the suburbs were always unruly. 

Cars waiting at red light was also very common and so was crossing street only when walk signal was on.

But there was always mad rush to board the trains. This is very refreshing.

 Queue!? ab ye kaunsi nayi western concept laye ho?

Hamare sanskriti mai koi queue nahi hota.Kabhi sunna hai pushpak viman mai chadte waqt log queue mai kadhe the?  If I were first in line, I'd just be terrified that the entire line will push forward at anytime even before the train arrives.  I recently made a trip to europe and I was amused to see how the locals were civil to other people. If there's something that Indians need to badly improve - its being civil to others. That huge fan though. People of Mumbai always surprise. The roads are crowded but flow is always smooth Its because its an A/C TRAIN. CIVILISED PEOPLE USE IT. JUST SAYIN  Yay, Mumbai! But there should be markers so that people can queue up on either side of the door and let people alight properly first. After looking this picture I am crying from inside.  Wait there are AC trains on the local lines? I catch a train from andheri in the evening everyday and this is a common sight only in the women's compartment though.. great to watch.

Also, andheri station is jam-packed in the morning and people had to literally fight for climbing up. The last two months have seen a major change and Now everyone stands in a proper queue Wow, this is the India I want to see.  Haath pe chapti maar re. Oh wait...... that's central line. Don't know when central line will become decent. Good to see some positive story since  ages This can only happen in non-rush hours in Mumbai Locals. 

If people start queuing at rush hour the line will stretch for 2 kms outside the station.  Aaja Bhai Tu Bhi Line Mein This is a very interesting experiment in Indian behaviour.

1. If you somehow project the idea of discipline onto people, 95% of them will follow. 50% of these will be rowdy and lawless while taking a local train but will suddenly stand in line because there's a line expected or being formed in front of them in the metro [I've seen this happen IRL].

 And while the line collapses pretty soon, it is still an attempt at order which partially succeeds in two ways - people can alight without battling through a wave of incoming bodies, and folks who are right in the front of these lines get assured seating/standing of their choice.

2. You will see people blatantly flouting rules, throwing their garbage on the floor etc. on normal train platforms. But our metro stations? They're some of the cleanest places in India. Just look at the difference in India's metros - be it Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai... The cities is filthy, the metro system is clean as a whistle.

3. The security system works. Not for its intended role, but it keeps loose food and drink outside the metro system.

I believe civic planners and govt officials can learn some lessons here. *Rechecks*
Am I on the right sub reddit ? 
*Rechecks* There is hope for the country. Demonitization actually had a few benefits!!! Next thing you know people will stop littering.  Then when the streets are clean the cops will stop beating and extorting street vendors and the poor.  Then that will have a snowball effect, and the road workers will start repairing roads with enthusiasm.  Traffic will move smoother and people will be in a better mood, they'll stop going out at night to rape innocent women and children.

Finally, the politicians will see all this and ask for 2% less bribe. This works only until the train arrives. Then it's a free for all. Nice quality! Which camera? Which station?

Back in 1990, while being transferred to the spot where it currently stands, the statue slipped and fell into the water body. Taking the lives of 10 people in the accident. The statue remained under water for 2 years before it was pulled back and erected to where we now see it. Year by year dumping Ganesh idols has made this into a garbage lake. The water is actually dark green in colour accompanied with exotic smells. Don't go by this picture! Bund = Ass (in punjabi) Necklace road right? Had my first kiss around here. Good memories.

Need a similar thread to collect data on dick and tit size of randians with proof ofc. Nice job OP but 100 isn't a good enough number to get a proper sample. Most people with average or below average height aren't likely to say it, so the average isn't necessarily an 'average'. Just wanted to add that caveat. Nice job otherwise!  How did you know my state? Garbage in garbage out. Iam a midget in my own country 😢 Jesus.... This wasn't about penile length. No need to lie for this one. The problem is most people overestimate their height. It's a common phenomenon. Most of my friends initially would say that they are 5'10 or 6 feet but they were quite shocked when actual measurement (using a stadiometer) showed that they overestimated their height by 2-3 inches their entire lives. Using a measuring tape to measure height might be prone to errors unless you are making sure that the tape is exactly perpendicular to ground. Even a slight difference in degree of inclination would result in overestimation by 1-2 inches. Therefore my tip would be to actually get measured guys. You'll be shocked !!

To reply to all of you -
1. The sample size is, of course, minuscule compared to our overall population of 1.3 Billion people. Actually it is just 0.0000001% of the entire population. So take the visualization with a *chutki bhar namak*.

2. The thread from which this data off of was not a proper survey. So, if you all are interested in a such visualizations, we can have short surveys using Google Forms.

3. I will be making more of such visualizations, since we don't have a dearth of data regarding India. You can check our own initiative here- [Data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/)

Activation of VAS went on for 3 weeks in which.I lost amount 5 to 9 rupees and each happens on a day to day basis. I was refunded the first two times. But, as it started happening on a daily basis, I was denied access to  their customer  care dept.( It was denied because, i was able to connect them through other Vodafone numbers)

 I took resort in Twitter and contacted them . They did reply instantly with a message that their executive will be calling as soon as possible. None of those people called. ( I continued pestering them for two days, still those hyprocrites were in connivance).
Only after emailing and doing MNP message , i got calls from Vodafone to ask why i did the MNP messages.( they wanted to know what made me to port from their network [and after all these calls and tweets] SMH).  They did refund ,but only after 2 emails, 10 tweets, and 3 calls from another number.

So , that was last month. Yesterday , I unknowingly used up my 1 GB data pack along with my remaining balance . As usual, I proceeded to recharge through Paytm. Surprise!!! processing failed!! one, two, three, leave it,  six times, the processing failed. Tried with the Vodafone App, nope!! all the tranaction pages starting showing 'Request page cannot be processed ' messages( data packs can be activated  but no talktime ones)Tried calling their customer care, again surprise!! call doesnt go through.

5. i was her tampon: check

exactly, thats what you'll be: a tampon, learnt that the hard way, quit her in 2015 after getting tired of her back and forth bullshit and uncertainty, she ll keep you locked but she wont say say, fuck that shit man, no one s got time for that... She sees you as a friend and has made it clear that she is not interested in you for anything intimate. It's best for you to use your emotions somewhere else. If you don't believe me then ask her clearly, saying hey <her name>, do you think we two could be together as a couple. She will give you a straight no. Start flirting with her. Take it slowly but definitely let her get the hint that you are interested in being more than just friends with her. You have hidden your intentions so far out of fear and maintaining this act is not going to help you. Some Chad might come into her life and take her away from you. If you don't tell her she'll never know. She also might have feelings for you that you don't know about. Be brave and tell her that you like her, but be subtle about it. See how she responds and then take it from there. Itna sudhra hua na Bano ki saamne vaale ko lage ki asexual ho Stop being her gay BFF and ask her out already. Otherwise, like the other guy said, emotional tampon bane reh jaoge. She will use your shoulder to cry on and find some other guy's dick to ride on.

I know it sounds rude, but its just the way the world works. Always better to learn the lesson early in life. Tell her your feelings either she says yes or friendship ends. Or she knows and keeps the friendship which is painful. And everyone knows.

Never followed them or such. They are for urban teenagers who don't have a sense of humour and don't know words beyond bhencho.

 Exactly! It’s just silly IMO  I was thinking this while going through their Instagram story as well. Kinda seems like an exercise in futility.

To Be Honest, The whole bashing of couples and the Valentine's Day/Week was fine until a certain point. Making light-hearted memes, cracking poor jokes was fine. But this whole hashtag and the upcoming events planned by AIB and others is meaningless and capitalises on the frustration of singles who can't get into a relationship despite desperately wanting to! I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this but I think it's a very clever marketing strategy. At the and end of the day AIB is a brand and they seem to have figured out a viral branding technique cashing in on the large pool of single people who are active on social media.

146,Non-Political,"I actually welcome the One Nation; One Tax system. But with GST, this primary objective is defeated when we have multiple tax rates. But there is hope the rates will be made homogeneous over a period of time.

GST is taunted  as a measure to reduce the paper work and complexity of businesses. But the government failed to address where WE the consumers are in the equation. It was advocated that the less procedures and simplicity in tax returns would increase the efficiency and would result in reduction of cost which will ultimately benefit the consumers.
However, with the raise of key services like banking, insurance, etc from the existing 15% service tax to 18% GST, the consumer interest takes back seat. For service industry I believe they should have atleast kept in a similar rates since there is no visible benefit when you are going to higher tax for the same shitty services.

The governments preparedness with systems is questionable since there were reports that the implementation dates should be postponed due to this. But the government is firm on implementing from July 1st, as with demonetization they are not bothered with the consequences. But this will ultimately affect the businesses and result in lower growth.

As you mentioned, registration with multiple states and filing returns would defeat the primary purpose of GST. Also for inter-state transactions, the government advised the business to continue using the existing forms, so the state border checkposts will remain.

Yes in longer run probably 3 - 5 years the system will mature and we may even have one single rate for all commodities in the future.

  To tell you the truth OP I still don't understand what the GST does . I mean I get the gist of it like all indirect taxes will be abolished , different tax rates by different states will now be the same but other than it I still don't know what it is going to do I think a lot of us cheered its passage, but in hindsight, I really think the BJP should have waited until securing its own majority in the Rajya Sabha instead. As you, OP, point out, they ended up having to make too many mini concessions to get everyone on board, and the effect was just replacing 28 different complicated, bureaucratic AF tax systems to one big one. 

But it's a step in the right direction. In hindsight a lot of Modi bhakts (myself included) naively supposed this was going to be a quick shot, overnight process - I think successive governments will keep tweaking it. Hopefully.

Also the article on Manipur deserves to be on the frontpage. They used satire in a smart way to draw attention to a serious issue which got neglected by the media. Divert faking news to /r/bakchodi  I find the 'Political' tag fairly apt for Faking News these days. It's become a propaganda site. Instead of ""humor"", I'd suggest ""satire"" flair if it's too necessary. Under humor flair, shitty Whatsapp political images about ""pappu, feku and bhagoda"" will get posted and just degrade the sub. I was just going to post this. It should be a ""satire"" flair.

I'm looking for neutral viewpoint and dispassionate analysis. I personally believe if you passionately hate or support something, you lose the objectivity.

I think it's a step in right direction. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement. I have couple of points to add. Please correct me if I’m wrong and share your valuable insights. Also, comprehensive study articles/papers is most welcome.


* For starters, the rates are quite confusing. and I spoke with a CA guy, he thinks there are a lot confusion as of now. So I think we can say it's in beta phase. After the implementation, govt would need to sort out various issues and make sure it increases the efficiency. Also, I think rates for various items have been decided in haste and randomly. So, that has to be addressed after the implementation.


* I think it doesn’t solve the central issue. Police at the state borders will make other excuses to stop trucks and demand bribes. One of my relatives is truck transporter. If the driver doesn’t pay the bribe, police simply break their headlights and then charge the fine. This is a lot common. In this respect, GST barely helps in faster movements of goods. Since petroleum and Alcohol has been kept out of GST, police can stop trucks to check these items.

* It’s far from one tax one nation. The proposed tax structure includes a Central GST, a State GST and an Interstate GST. “Given the current structure, if a person does business in three States, he has to get six registrations and make a number of regulatory filings.

* The Central GST Bill allows the central government to set up an anti-profiteering authority by law, or designate an existing authority to carry out the functions.  The authority will be responsible for ensuring that the reduction of tax rates on account of implementation of GST results in a commensurate reduction in prices.  India has had bad experience with new monitoring bodies. I am afraid this will simply turn another method of officials to strong-hand the honest business and extort money if there is no proper oversight on anti-profiteering body. CVC in railway was established to catch corrupt officials. It is yet to catch a single official and we know how much corruption is there. This will lead to more govt; more govt means more corruption and inefficiency.

* I think it will take atleast 2-3 years to have clarity on rates and various legal issues. Till then, there would be chaos and inflation will generally increase. After that, if govt make right iterations, we might see the benefit of GST.

* Lastly, In India reforms generally work in different way. Govt takes 3 steps ahead and after much brouhaha it takes the two steps back. So, you are left with only one step in right direction which is better than zero steps ahead.

A Zomato lesbian ad could have been much better.

""But I cooked yesterday!""

""Fuck it, let's just eat out.""

Cue *Bow chicka bow wow* Nope, still not downloading the Myntra app If they r lesbians, which one gets dowry? This isn't an ad.. this is a short movie.  This is absolutely disgusting. What the fuck is happening to our culture? How can we allow this? Why the fuck is she is marrying a north Indian? 

Edit: Holy shit, my fourth gold in the last two months! Thank you /u/robojunkie for this gilding Kudos! Although I guess the first one was by fastrack : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmk9D53G6F8 Couldn't take this shit. The Tamil was horrendous.  The kurthas were *meh*.. Good thing Myntra does not have a offline store 😜  Seriously impressed!

Would love to see this and other ads like this air on national television. When more and more kids start seeing these things on TV, the more ""normal"" it becomes for them. What is this ~~ad~~ short movie about? It just shows two people in a relationship where one person is waiting for her parents to show up. I felt that the advt. was more focused on showing the relationship than the kurta! Ads can be lesbian too. TIL. Plot twist. The girl in blue is actually dying of cancer and is breaking the news to her parents.  Good job. LGBT rights are an important contemporary issue and there is an urgent need for a public conversation in this regard. Sensitizing the public about different sexualities is a very welcome initiative. 

That said, corporate appropriation of a social cause is ALWAYS meant for profiteering, and any positive effect is merely incidental, not at all a stated aim. **A good example is how the Tobacco companies targetted women by making cigarettes a symbol women's liberation**.

Who ate Chow mein amongst them? As a South Indian, I am impressed that recent movies / ads are casting super hot girls as South Indians.

168,Non-Political,"Wow. TLDR? Wow what a nice read. But there was no mention of famines or partitions. Were they not back-breaking for the economy? [deleted] I don't think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an ""evil"" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they've committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  

IMHO, he's raising awareness about the atrocities that they've committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor's main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in 'India Unbound'. But I don't think it really contradicts Tharoor's claims . Everyone of Das' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding ""India"" back but he let's the Brits go Scott free.

Yes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a ""Indian"" structural head who could've changed things or we could've had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. 

The drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the ""gifts"" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb's tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad's Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could've been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn't be as poor as we are now.

A book came out last year called ""Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830"" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. 

He makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans’ awareness of the Company’s conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and “despotic” empire . Following the Revolution, America’s connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods.

I'm done. I wouldn't call 100+ of looting and injustice ""peaceful."" Have read the whole thing.
The Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.

Taking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.

This they did by creating:
Low literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you'll fail to compete.)

Unstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn't moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn't these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980's they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can't deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn't right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let's just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.

Personally I'm glad for stuff like outlawing Sati and reforming personal laws which I'm sure most of our post independence governments wouldn't have the guts to touch. Was India ever a rich nation in the first place? People use the 27% of world GDP stat to justify the label but we had 27% of the world population also at that time. 

Both Shashi Tharoor and Gurcharan Das are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation.  Slightly off topic, but I believe much of Tharoor's British bashing is just shrewd political posturing. When he first ran for parliament in 2009, the Nair community voted for him en masse because ""he is one of us"". The educated/liberal class voted for him because he had the ""it"" factor, undersecretary general of the UN, erudite, sophisticated etc. He won handily, with a huge margin. In 2014, a lot of the older Nairs voted BJP because ""they stand for Hindu values"" (evidence for this is anectodal, everyone in my (+wife's) family voted Tharoor in 2009, most of our parents' generation voted BJP in 2014). Tharoor still had the youth/liberal vote and won, but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009. A huge slide. In 2019, he faces the prospect of running against Suresh Gopi (popular actor, current BJP RS MP), and stands a real risk of losing. I consider his anti-Brit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowd.

It is really simplistic to claim Britain ""looted"" us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of India's wealth was concentrated in the hands of Zamindars, Nawabs and Rajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the Indian sub-continent before the British brought it all together. Well Tharoor is not completely wrong either. India was rich, maybe not as rich as all those WhatsApp forwards mention like 27% of world GDP and other crap. I also believe that Tharoor's fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches. I think he's going to use this wave of false patriotism that's been around which makes people patriots on social media, to his advantage in the next elections. I mean - no one really discusses if a robbery is ""overall a good thing"" even if it did help turn someone's life around in a positive way.  > The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

- North Indians are disproportionately *proud* of their culture, their history, their food & their language. OK, those things are not so bad, but FFS, stop assuming everyone else's religion/culture/history/food/language is worse than yours & stop trying to expect everyone else to put up with it.

- South Indians think they are more their  religion/culture/history/food/language is the best, they won't impose it on you, because think non-South Indians are not intelligent/cultured enough to appreciate it. i was born and broughtup in Jammu (can't go a lot more north than that) and am currently in Bangalore for an internship, have visited chennai, mumbai and stayed in Goa for a month for another internship last year.

I honestly don't see any difference apart from language, i am not being politically correct but people are exactly the same everywhere, Rajasthan, UP, Punjab, Delhi, etc.

if you understand their language and the different customs there is no difference. btata -> alu or po-tae-too -> po-taa-too As a northie, southies for me are:

1) Mostly Polite.

2) Less likely to take pride in being an ass.

3) Peculiar/curious habits regarding food. Like having rice for breakfast. is impossible for me. 

4) Disgusting porn. Most Indian porn is shit anyway.



I haven't lived in any southern state and impression is from various people I've met till now.

 What are people from Goa, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Assam? North Indians or south Indians? My North-South experience is mostly shaped by me being a NRI Guju who had South Indian roommates and friends at my American university

- South Indians are very humble and polite. Even the Southie party types are somehow modest about it, lol. I knew of exactly one douchebag Southie in college. All the pompous irresponsible d-bags were North Indian.
- At the same time, certain South Indians can be extremely arrogant about their perceived superiority. This was the case with my main roommate, A Tamilian, who considered everything outside the very South to be ""North India"". He thought North Indians were scum for their eagerness to be ""white"". He thought of North Indians as white people basically while South Indians are the true Indians who came directly from Africa. He hated North Indians for their lighter skin, big noses and considered South Indians' darkness to be a virtue.
- I actually agree with some of those thoughts. I think North India is inferior in many respects (education, morality, proportional advances made for India). I do think North Indians are excessively obsessed with being seen as modern by the West. *Grabs popcorn* Northeast feels neglected again.  Disconnect happens when one is too stringent with their own customs and language. 

If you are making effort to learn about each other, one does not see disconnect just the varying of degrees/levels of customs. 

I'm from the east... Have friends from J&K to Kanyakumari and Arunachal Pradesh to Gujarat. Few are lurking here right now.

Sorry about your bad experience in Chennai the language barrier does bring in some ugly side of the city but trust me it is in general a lovely place if you discount the heat. Basic Tamil (Tamizl) is easy to pick up. get that under your belt and you will see the difference.

Bangalore has always been multicultural. It was a retirement destination of Army guys. Damn cultured though deteriorating now. Tempers are down because of the weather unlike Chennai :)

Love both the places for different reasons.   Bring on the hate Where is /u/maderchodlungibaaz? i find northies cool. i just dont understand why they dont wear lungi I had a big rant. But after reading what I had written I think it's better I don't post it :( I realize that I haven't interacted on a personal level with any North Indian before to make any kind of call.

But an interesting incident happened to my parents. They had gone to Punjab (forget which city) and asked around for a place to stay. Immediately the Sikh maama invited my parents to stay in their home. More like forcefully insisted. My parents were really touched. Except for one niggle. Apparently the family had this little servant-girl they constantly shouted at. People in TN at least are very vocal about their rights and the servants here brook no disrespect. My parents, on returning to Chennai, sent the Punjabi family a Kancheepuram silk dress. Jerks gonna be jerks; there ain't no north-south divide for that.  I was once Driving in Himachal and was overtaking on a single lane road. a guy hanging from a tempo coming from opposite side yelled .. ""Delhi vall hai Delhi valla""  Apparently he could pick up where I was from  even thought I was driving a car with Himachal no plate, just buy watching my driving style( which I am not now very proud of now) I figure highly insulated/inbred northie or southie tend to run into issues. 
Some exposure and mental acceptance makes either much better to be around. 
That said, you are more likely to meet an insular northie, than corresponding southie simply due to force of numbers.  Weekly Paratha-Butter Chicken vs Idly-Sambhar thread.

Weekly Big B vs Thalaiva thread. I am north indian, who has many south indian ""friends"". I have many other friends from various parts of the country, mainly because I lived in a hostel, which had people from all over the country. While I know, many north indians, tend to have some stereotypical image of south indians, and vice versa, I for one, always avoided acting on any such impulses, and tried my best treating everyone, for who they are. But boy, i was wrong!!. I dont want to be diplomatic here, But really, south indians hate north indians. They dont even want to make an effort to move out and socialise with people from other places. Language is a barrier, but I can cut them some slack there, because they say they are most comfortable in their own languages. But really, in my current group, i am the only north indian, with a group of kannada people. And they cant stop trying to put me down, at any instance possible. This is not a unique experience. They are unobjective, and they think their values are the ones that should be abided by everyone else. They refuse to make a slightest change in their understanding in trying to understand a different person.

The only south indian good friends that I have, are the ones, who for the most part, havent lived there. I know you can say the same about north indians as well. But well, I am just ranting about my experience here, Well, I can't figure out why there are almost no northie guys getting roles as heroes but almost every other heroines are of northern origin in southern movies. Why?  Naan prod Punjabi Kannadiga saar.  I think South Indians are too meek. But they are polite too. 

Other than that they are as much jerks as all Indians.

OP you should have started with your experiences. As an ABCD, I just find all of this so ridiculous and hilarious. Here in the States, I consider my Indian friends as ""Indian"" and don't look at their last names, what states they are from, etc. This is probably one of the biggest reasons there's so much of a disconnect in the country between different people.

They have been heavily downvoted and the language they speak in is rather repulsive. i'm commenting on that..I should have been more clear about that so i'm sorry.

Sorry but everytime I try a Dosa I can't have any more than one bite. Even Chicken Chettinad doesn't go down well. And your papad is just weird.

That sums up my opinion of the southern cultures [removed] On behalf of my telugu friend-north indians are very selfish except punjabis. Chennai sux, most of the south indian cities suck. I can vouch for it.


PS: I am a south indian by birth shish :| Raised for several years in Delhi, people genetically 'South Indian' but brought up there are 'North Indian' in every way apart from color and maybe genetic propensity to different diseases. 

At a high level South Indians are more risk averse and prudent. North Indians especially those who come from regions which have seen lot of war in past ( Punjab, Kashmir) have much higher propensity for taking risk. This actually defines lot of other behavior you see and sterotypes you have about either.  Black color ; nariyal waley. They mix all their food on a leaf and eat with their hands. The same hands that they scratched their balls with.  Cmon when u mix sambar rasam chutney together then how can u enjoy the taste of each.rofl. 

To be honest; there black complexion is a turn off for fairness crazed north. I feel this is wrong as north indians are also not true white in compared to european. But defintly far fairer than a madrasi.

Ah south of goa is all madras. We dont know tamil telugu mallu kanada ltte etc. All are madrasis who wear lungi and have fat actors dancing there bellies.

#fuck you valve
Fix the bloody Indian dota 2 servers. Its fucking unplayable. 22 year old me, with my best friend(know her since a long time), head to a bar with other friends. Get high. Dunno how we started kissing when others went to loo or what ever. Kissed twice. I regularly visit that place. First kiss at 17 in coaching class with fwb.  Cheeks or lips? Never happened ;_; [deleted] Waiting for one.  End of 11th grade. Made out in an empty classroom for over twenty minutes. Best kiss ever Anyone watching Barca Bayern match tonight? Holy fuck kxip got analed. My first kiss would be when I was 19 - yeah pretty late but pretty much made up for that. I have a date - actually a drinking date - with a Polish girl this week. First time it was supposed to happen ->

Met my GF for the second time at a restaurant. We were warming up to each other when a text came to my cell and she read it. It was from my ""back-up"" long distance GF. Long story short, kissy toh huwa nahi, break up ho gaya. :(

First time it happened ->

Fast forward two years. Same girl. Same city. Different restaurant. We sat at the corner table, hidden from rest of the restaurant. She goes ""Jaldi se kissy karlo. Koi aa jayega"". :P I cupped her face and kissed. :) See Abhijeet defending Salman on Twitter. ek number ka chutiya insaan

Also today's ipl match. Lulz.

I'm awkward with guys more than girls lel. I don't talk to a lot of people though. Plz to Advice : 

Why is it necessary for guys (specially me) to keep on initiating the conversations. When i am just looking at being friends. Why do girls do that? If you arent believing in having friendship with a  guy say me, the fuck do you be a chatterbox once i initiate the conversation.

Experience holders and girls plz to advice . Honestly i am not hitting on them then also they do it like this. Kya hai bhenchod 

I hate it when people throw their fits over me, and then fucking turn off your cellphones and disappear. This just because they assumed something about me? And didn't listen to me?

I'm a South Indian male in Maharashtra and I have applied to Christ College in Banglore (which happens to be my native place, sort of) for a triple major programme (BA PSEng and PSEco) and my interview is on the 13th of May. Now, this is the only place where I applied, so not getting in will be difficult even though I'm quite confident that I'll get in.

I come from a reputed school and junior college (Smt. Sulochanadevi Singhania School) with what I consider sub-par marks (64% average in 11th, which is the marksheet I had to submit) and I need some help with this interview, especially from someone who has hopefully gone through the same process before.

Now I don't know anything at all about interviews and I have many questions (how ironic) and I'll be very grateful to have them answered. My questions mainly revolve around a general interview and not ""what questions do they ask"" or something like that. The things that I am sure I have covered are my attire and myself. However, there are things that I doubt very largely.

What am I supposed to bring to this sort of interview?

.


If I'm supposed to bring a Portfolio, what should that contain? In what format? I'm absolutely clueless.

.


On a scale of 1 to 10, how much can I ""brag""? 1 being ""I am educated"" and 10 being listing all my talents, anything I have ever achieved in life, proficiency in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, etc.

.


How do I convey that I am more than that piece of paper? How much should I keep to myself?

.


I'm not too artsy, so how fancy should my portfolio look? Is a simple, plain, printed text sheet enough? (I'm really good at editing though, so I can handle digital stuff well)

.


How much weightage do my board marks carry? I scored well in 10th and stayed afloat in 11th and 12th. I'm hoping that my 12th boards will be reflective of my intellectual value, so I'd also like to know which standard is looked at more specifically or if it's looked at as a learning curve.

>what were negative aspects of the Islamic invasion of India?

Islamic invaders went a few step beyond greek invaders...they destroyed temples , religious & educational institutions, they forced conversions literally & by deceiving & by luring with financial gains...There were moderate Muslim rulers like Akbar (Which I agree is suspicious)...some say that if Dara Shikoh was not killed by Aurangzeb, India would have been a different place right now. Poetry,Urdu,food,architecture and design,first set of roads,pigeon telegrams,jagirdari was abolished in some areas,established, developed and fortified hyderabad and delhi as a state of wealth and power,introduced jizya and zakat to elevate the poor.

Negative - Forced conversions in some places - jizya was exclusive to non muslims,internal fueds which killed a lot of people,wiped out most of the rajputs

202,[R]eddiquette,"I honestly don't understand how forcing a child to do what you think has more money, will make the child happy?

From my experience, I will say that please, only do a Masters in something, if you're genuinely interested and motivated to pursue that subject. You don't just go to an institute, get a degree and then are inundated with buttloads of money. It's hard work. You are developing a finer specialization in a field. And if you're are genuinely not motivated, it can end terribly.

The most important thing right now for you, I think, is to carefully think which profession you want to get in. Money is an important criterion, but I think the 3 fields you mention, they all pay well and sufficient for you to live comfortably. The most crucial question is: what work do you enjoy? What do you see yourself doing for years, day in and day out? Sometimes you will be thinking about work during your free time. Which of those 3, Graphic Design, MBA and Civil, do you see yourself giving your all? Something that you can work on, for hours and hours?

My background: I went into engineering, against my father's wishes. He wanted me to go into medical, and I sucked in that. You can imagine the drama that ensued because of my decision. He was threatening to disown me. The whole Indian TV soap drama.

Then I went abroad for Masters in Theoretical Physics. This was something that developed gradually. I kept asking ""why?"" to engineering questions, delved deeper and deeper, and got hooked on Modern Physics. I naturally wanted to do a PhD, and got a scholarship for that. Now I have a good job abroad. It's not all rainbows and roses. Some days are really damn hard and it's a pain to get through the work. But at the end of the day, I am still grateful I took this path, made my own decisions, and live the consequences.

This is your life. You are the one who will actually have to do the work. Your parents/uncles/aunties/friends *might* think that this is better for you or that. But you are the one who has to live your entire life on those decisions. Why not make an informed, well-thought one?

207,[R]eddiquette,"I just hope he completely attends the AMA and not leave if he find us 'intellectually incapable' of conducting a good AMA! :P  Ooh this should be very very interesting! 

I'll have a bunch of nice questions ready. 


Also, prepare to see a deluge of journalists here now. He's hot topic in the press right now  I bet Deepinder Goyal will be watching over this to see how bad Rahul fucks this up. *grabs popcorn* Yaar this ama will be awesome but this will attract whole bunch of chu media :( THIS IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN ! *goes and giggles in the corner like a black and white movie monster* Will be hard pressed to ask him about middlemen businesses vs creating real tangible value in a country like India I am a Corporate Governance researcher, and I find Rahul Yadav's announcements very interesting and disturbing at the same time. I will be very interested in knowing his thoughts behind:

1. How does he plan to have incentives aligned with success of Housing.com/convince investors that he is motivated, after giving away all his equity to employees. 

2. Is there a grey market for Housing.com shares. How can employees monetize the gift?

3. Isn't there regulation in India, that constrain private firms to have less than 50 investors, before becoming public. In that case, how can the shares be transferred to employees?

4. I have tracked Zillow/Trulia for a while. These firms have mapped a larger geography, and onboarded about a 100,000 agents to pay for ads connected to Zip codes. Still they are struggling with their bottomline, agent retention and agent up selling (They treat agents as their revenue sources, not end use customer). If Housing.com will be following a similar model, is it having success in onboarding agents? Is it having trouble with the unorganized/informal nature of real estate agents? What is being done to mitigate it?

5. Are the online only flash sales of apartments generating any revenue at all? Is it a sustainable model for the future?

6. What happened behind the scenes and how were the board members pacified to retain the CEO? How did men with big egos and the cash to boost, look beyond the tantrums to come to a rational decision? Alright, which one of you requested an AMA with this attention whore? ARE YOU SERIOUS?! maza aaega. rakhi sawwant of startups. lots of yummy questions to ask this guy #LookingUp to it http://i.imgur.com/NnoGhN1.gif I have a very genuine question for Rahul, hope it doesn't get moderated.

Rahul, what do you smoke ? how much do you pay for it ? and how many times a day do you smoke it ? You got Rahul- oh. Never mind. Awesome, 
this will gonna be awesome, but it will attract a bunch of rubbish media.  Monk who sold his ferrai? Or the monk whose driver refused to drive unless he gave away his ferrari We are so lucky to have few out of those precious ~3L working hours he is left with! After doing all these stunts.. Do you sleep well? How much do you sleep? **Do you even sleep?** Because I have seen you post on facebook early in the morning at 4 A.M. or 5 A.M.... Your situation is like *""Raaton ki neend gai, din ka chain gya.. kya hota hai ye klook[up] klook[up] klook[up]..."" ???* He is in his chappals btw in that verification pic. :D

edit- No offence meant. Calling Deepinder. This one would b an epic AMA ! I think he'll do a U-turn in the last minute, skip the AMA and flip the bird to all of us. Lets do bets...how long before MSN/ Clickbait sites pick this story up & which one will be first...winner get a puppy people get oil and frying pans ready ;). let me leave now to buy a pack of popcorn :) Going to be a nightmare for the Grammar Nazis.

How do we use this reddit AMA firstly? Hi Rahul, many thanks for doing this AMA.

My question : **What are the 3 most important things that contribute towards a startups' success in the Indian startup ecosystem?** 

Please be as candid as possible.

 Its happening here guys - http://ss.reddit.com/r/india/comments/36hezf/hi_im_rahul_yadav_ceo_of_housingcom_ama/ When does this start??
 Tell him to get some lube.  This is going to be fun! *Marks the calendar* *Rubs hands in glee* What about Rahul Baba?  There is a lot of confusion in the ecosystem right now, everyone is there with his/her own opinion on the recent events. It is now time we actually hear one side of the story in first person. I am having my college exams and you know engineers study at last moment still I am gonna attend it. I signed up just for this one AMA. No matter what he says, there's going to be roughly equal number of people who admire him, and those that make fun of him.

Sorta, kinda like AK or NaMo. This is one to watch out for, for sure! He's the Balotelli of startups. ♪ Yeh to hona hi tha ♪ But...but...are we worthy? Remind me to here at 6 pm IST on May 19th. /u/remindmebot I hope he stops behaving like his other namesake in politics. It is a great opportunity to get to know his part of the story. I just joined in reddit to participate in this AMA :)  Who would you say has inspired you the most and why? Do you consider yourself successful? Is there more to housing.com than VC money? GUYS BRING YOUR ALTS WITH THE MOST FUCKED UP USERNAMES I hope this session dosent turn into a ROast  [removed] Let the games begin! Just got a reddit handle for this  This is going to be fun....waiting :D 30 minutes to go. Let's see what unfolds!
 Let's say I were to cruise up to your local bar with my IIT D t-shirt. I sit down at the bar and order an overpriced old monk. I grab the remote from behind the bar and change the channel to Roadies. I strut over to the jukebox and play some Linkin Park and ask your old lady for a dance.

How do you feel about Digital India ? What you would be doing. If you leave Housing.com Where is the ama going on ?! what will be your next kick? r u a salman khan fan?? Did you just kept thinking to get an idea or u just got it one night in dreams?
How do you find people with same level of enthusiasm as you for an idea? Why you all are **""Die Hard"" Fans of Steve Jobs**? There were other people on this planet who has done commendable jobs in their fields. IF your resignation was not a publicity stunt what was the reaction of Mr. Shailenra and other board members over your letter? Hey Rahul,
How you are able to take such big decision in very short time? can we start?
 give some tips on your digital marketing campaigns according to me they are huge i mean you are everywhere on the internet (housing.com) Why you all are **""Die Hard"" Fans of Steve Jobs**? There were other people on this planet who had done commendable jobs in their fields.   Are you planning to open housing office in Seattle?
Just curious because my current home is having water pipe burst...:-) when will you enter into the sf and give a kick to us startups?
lets play a story telling video on the home page instead of static html pages
bull shit?? What does Rahul have to say about the comments comparing him to Arvind Kejriwal? Nice. Say what you want about his behavior, he has been more successful than 99% of the people on r/india. Looking forward to the AMA. This looks like 100% PR stunt... Rahul, are you Rakhi Sawant? don't rediquette tag the AMA  The best thing about this is that he is going to literally Answer Your Anything... Interesting...

Hey /r/India,  
**Rahul Yadav** has agreed for an AMA session with us. He's been in the headlines quite a lot recently, and has even been coined as the ""*monk who sold his Ferrari*"" by a [few media outlets](http://www.firstpost.com/business/rahul-yadav-really-monk-sold-ferrari-decoding-housing-com-ceos-rs-200-cr-gift-employees-2243666.html).  

So get your questions ready and let's have an interesting AMA here on /r/india. Please keep in mind that it will be [R]eddiquette enforced so we will be moderating to ensure civility. 

**Bio:**

>Rahul hails from Alwar, Rajasthan where he received his primary education. He later went to IIT Bombay for higher studies, where he created a question bank from old exam papers to build the popular Exambaba.com. Exambaba was made the official IIT-B archive before eventually being shut down. After a brief internship in Israel, Yadav returned to build apps for Google Chrome. And then, in his final year, dropped out of IIT. Later, he joined his friends to co-found Housing.com.

208,[R]eddiquette,"As pointed out by dexbg; there isn't a bifurcation known as political defamation.

Understand that civil and criminal defamation are the same thing in essence;  civil defamation is a concept under tort law; which in India is not codified, meaning there is no Act or written rule for torts but  criminal defamation falls under S 499 of the IPC which is a codified law.

The main difference between Civil & Criminal proceeding for defamation is pertaining to compensation. While the object of Civil action is to adequately compensate the person defamed for the loss of reputation by damages; the object of Criminal prosecution is to punish the offender by way of imprisonment of fine or both.

214,[R]eddiquette,"There are blow-by-blow responses to his conjectures, and I'll just cite an obvious one here:

> * People like Bhagwati believe we should concentrate on  economic growth and the poor will ultimately be helped; whereas, if you concentrate on other things, growth might suffer and as a result, so will the poor. In that chain of arguments there is a dual process. One is that high growth means more jobs. So if the poor have more jobs, they will have more income. Two, if there’s growth, the economy expands and taxes go up.

> *  With that money, you can fund anti-poverty programmes. On the face of it, this is a plausible argument. But it doesn’t always work. For instance, even in the highest growth period in India, **say between 2003-08**, most of the evidence shows that employment didn’t grow much.

Here is [Livemint's Claim Check](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/fI98V9JE8uOmAhVS0fjhQO/Claim-Check-Narendra-Modi-on-jobs-created-by-NDA-vs-UPA.html) on the topic:

>Claim: The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government created 60 million jobs during its tenure in 1999-2005 as against 2.7 million created during 2004-2009 under the current United Progressive Alliance government.

> Who: Narendra Modi.

> Where: At a rally in Rohini, Delhi.

> Check: Modi is right. Between 1999-2000 and 2004-05, there were 60.7 million new jobs that were created as against 2.76 million new jobs between 2004-05 to 2009-10.

> Source: Institute of Applied Manpower Research, Planning Commission.

This illustrates how ""growth"" and ""development"" are not isolated and dead unlively numbers but on-the-ground impacts. How in the relatively low growth 5y period of NDA rule, they were able to add fucking 57 MILLION more jobs than the UPA in a *high* growth 5y period!

This is also not getting much news coverage.  

This sort of thing is the reason why India and China haven't resolved its border dispute Because India can not resolve it.  

China has resolved All of its Land borders in a 3 decade blitz. Except India and Bhutan(which is also because of India)  

India can't even get to terms with Bangladesh and it took 40 years for India to enter negotiation with a neighbor like Bangladesh in 2011 on the border issue.

222,Scheduled,"Startup definition in India is at nascent stage , valley philosophy needn't apply to village. What exists is convoluted definition where we try to apply philosophies of established startup environments like San Fransisco, London etc. here.

A startup in India has more business values to gain from street side vendor than what is projected on Tech Crunch, so let's be conservative when it comes to using the term 'Startup' and call what it is in India - A 'Business' like any another.

I started my company in 2014, when 'Startup' was not officially recognised in India by govt. in any form from a former village in a Tier 2 city. We built lifestyle products using funds from providing services to niche customers in VSAT space (Internet via satellite), Biometrics etc.

After a series of dud products, we saw our success with chat-app network dating product which was eventually accelerated by Facebook. Unfortunately,  the success didn't last long as I had to close my company this year because of my health issues (I was the single founder).

Though the reason for closing my company (startup?) was entirely mine, there were several areas in which I could have seen success much earlier only if I had started my company in a better ecosystem. Because I built international products, I had to compete with startups from better ecosystems like SF, Singapore, Tel Aviv etc. thereby in a competitive disadvantage.

The areas of improvement for the startup ecosystem in India are plenty both from government and in the attitude of the entrepreneurs . I'm now utilising my experience to help other [entrepreneurs](https://hitstartup.com) and occasionally respond to startup related comments here. A lot of gov initiatives are focused towards startups, accessing them is tough though. I my experience India has one of the most supportive startup ecosystems. What exact support are you looking for? If you want office space for a few of you use mine in Bangalore. Would be happy to help in any other way. Just reach out. Is there a subreddit for Indian startups? If not we should start one. Good idea. There are a few slack threads. Subreddit should help I wasn't expecting such response for this thread & I still think there's some scope for improving the startup culture in India. First thing first is to develop an environment to make open discussion, feedback, advices, etc. What's better than our own r/india, so I think I'll start out small with fortnightly discussion threads or twice a month and see how much traction does it create. We can accordingly either move over to a seperate subreddit altogether or come up with Discourse forum or something alike.

Anyway massive thanks to u/hitstartup and u/jdontherocks for your valuable inputs. Especially u/hitstartup, I've read your blog, the satirical comic strips you created are quite humorous and is pretty relatable. I remember this one time when I attended a startup meet and the people there were pretty awkward & boring, barely speaking anything interesting about their products but were quick to hand out their business cards. Besides, I hope you recover quick from your surgery and get back to actions since some of us can use your experience and knowledge in the field to hone our skills.

Looking forward to having more conversations such as this. Thank you all. Indians do much much more 'Startups' than you think. It's just that most of these won't fit your typical VC Fuelled Silicon Valley model of ""Go Big or Go Home"" definition of startup. 

In IT it has been quite easy to create a multi-million dollar outsourcing company in few years time with very high probability of success whereas doing a typical silicon valley like startup mostly ends up nowhere. Still there are a lot of product companies who have made sustainable business in internet space and went to IPO. Naukri, Shaadi, Justdial, Redbus, MMT etc. Others like Paytm, Zomato, BookMyShow, Practo etc are doing fine too.

And the most successful cash-rich startup has been Jio. It has all the qualities of a silicon valley startup with deep pockets - like Uber, and has disrupted the market just like uber did.

So I was wondering if you've a startup or did and it failed for some reason or the other, how was the experience? What lessons did you learn from it? Do you've plans for another one? What were some bureaucratic hurdles you have faced and how are you supposed to tackle them?

A fact that caught me by surprise was that the IT sector contributes 7.7% to the GNP which definitely correlates to the fact that the tech environment in the country isn't as impotent as suggested by various reports. Agreed that a significant portion of the software engineers are in need of a major reskilling but look at the bigger picture. India is a country of 1.3Bn people and out of it, for a small section of the populace who are into IT, to contribute close to 8% of the \~3Tn economy is damn huge! 

Considering this, it's hard to believe that, not even one of those millions strong IT workforce failed to come up with a noble and most importantly a sustainable business of his/her own. Anyway, that's just my opinion from looking at certain statistics and although numbers rarely lie but sometimes fail to portray a bigger picture of an underlying issue.

I'm looking to having an open discussion here and if it works out maybe I could try out a scheduled discussion thread on startups, to discuss everything from ideas to official procedures, etc. So tell me more about your startup(s) and help me understand the startup scenario better in this country.",Disappointing startup environment here in India

228,Scheduled,">There are currently 84 seats for scheduled tribes and 47 seats for scheduled castes, which amounts to a total of 131 seats, a significant number to make their voices heard and be a part of mainstream politics.

Those reserved seats change location (afaik) and aren't concentrated in a region but spread over the country. 

With reserved seats, when a person from reserved seat would have won, s/he wouldn't have faced the strongest candidate from that area, and hence would likely not gain power later when it isn't reserved. 

This means which ever SC/ST MPs win they likely aren't first choice of the people and unlikely to repeat which means they lack power which you expect from 131 seats. More over MPs from these seats are from different parties, leading to them having different agendas. 

Mayawati for example is from SC. And, BSP is a party that campaigns on SC/ST/OBC agenda, but mostly serves its leaders. Scheduled tribes are almost always from states with marginal political impact. In case of SC MPs they do come from large states. But again the largest of these block come from UP. And you would notice the most visible SC MPs come from UP as well. Also the mainstream parties either intentionally or unintentionally sideline the SC/ST MPs. Case in point Jual Oram. He was the only MP from BJP from Odisha. Now Smriti Irani/Dharmendra Pradhan  were inducted into cabinet in high visibility ministries where as Jual Oram got relatively obscure Ministry (SC&ST affairs). Congress was even worse. In 2009 Congress won 6 seats from Odisha in 2009. 3 Of those were from ST/SC seats. None were in the council of ministers. This was answered by Ambedkar himself.

There is joint electorate with reservation. However the population of SC (and ST) is too low to ensure majority.

So the majority community would field a candidate who belongs to SC (and ST), but would actually represent the interests of the majority community.

Ergo, not benefit the SC (and ST).

**Francesca R. Jensenius (2017). Social Justice through Inclusion** confirms this.
1.	Condition of SC in reserved constituency is not better than non reserved constituency
2.	overall development of reserved constituency is not worse off then non reserved constituency
3.	has transferred the power to leaders of SC(and ST) community.

Thus Ambedkar was right in asking for separate electorates. It’s because these leaders are fielded primarily by political parties because there is constitutional requirement to field such candidates. Take that away, and I can promise you that representation would go down significantly. Just look at muslim representation in legislatures. Even parties like BSP don’t field SC candidates from unreserved seats because they know that they will not get votes.

Most mainstream political parties are also not interested in development of Dalit political leadership. All they want is Congress Dalit leader or BJP Dalit leader or [insert your party] Dalit leader. If these leaders move away from the party line on Dalit issues then they will face the music.

Another issue is that the mainstream media is dominated by upper classes and they will invite Dalit figures only to speak on Dalit issues. For everything else, the upper classes will be the voice. Look at TV debates in UP, you will find that all spokesmen and panelists tend to be disproportionately Brahmins or Thakurs as if other communities simply don’t have anyone to speak on topics of national and local importance. It’s true that some of these are down to structural makeup of society but there is no serious attempt either to change it. It is because of the faulty design of SC/ST elections in our country. Which Ambedkar realized soon after independence. 

In the system of reserved seats and not separate electorates... 
Let us consider a example. 
There is a staunch dalit party who actively rails against the sawarnas and genuinely wish to work for dalits. Their candidate for the reserved seat is Mr. Dalit. He is extremely popular among the dalits of that area. 

Then there is a centrist or right wing party who don't have much fucks to give about dalits. They find a dalit ready to sell his soul for getting elected or for money so they get Mr. Sold to stand on the reserved seat. Mr. Sold is unpopular among dalits of the area. 

The seat has 30% dalit population. When elections comes, all those 30% vote for Mr. Dalit. 
But the rest who are not very happy about this dalit party will vote for Mr. Sold. He will win by a great margin. 

And hence will come in Parliament a dalit who is not going to speak a word about dalit issues. 

Ambedkar... Grand leader Ambedkar stood for two LS elections and lost both. In the second one, he came third. :)

It is only then that he realized that reserved seats are meaningless. This is why Ambedkar wanted separate electorate for SC/ST. That's why ""poona act"" which he agreed to when Gandhi went on hunger strike is considered worse thing for dalits.

>Underlying the feverish display of nationalism by the urban middle-class, comprised predominantly of upper-caste Indians, is an irony that few have paid attention to—the lower-caste poor account for most of the deaths. I tracked the caste background of the 40 CRPF jawans whose deaths were confirmed immediately after the attack. While the names of a few jawans revealed their respective caste identities, for those bearing caste-neutral last names, I spoke with their family members on telephone numbers registered with the CRPF. I also determined the caste identities through conversations with journalists who covered the jawans’s cremation; local politicians; social activists; sociologists; and by scanning media reports.

>The 40 jawans were primarily from lower-caste communities. In all, they comprised 19 jawans from Other Backward Classes (or backward castes), seven from Scheduled Castes, five from Scheduled Tribes, four from upper-caste backgrounds, one high-caste Bengali, three Jat Sikhs, and one Muslim. So, only five out of the 40 jawans, or 12.5 percent, came from Hindu upper-caste backgrounds.

To some extent I can see how colleges with 85 or 90% limits might be pushing it beyond reasonable student error.

But a lot of colleges enforce it up to 75% including my own. And of the people I know who didn't make 75%, it was usually because they just slept in during classes or were getting wasted or high the night before. If someone had a medical reason they'd usually be allowed but the others were absolutely not. 

I notice people are quite opinionated on this topic here but I'd like to ask what you actually do when you bunk class. Someone once claimed that you could read your material online or take MOOCS but I somehow doubt that's what most people do. It takes a great degree of self-discipline to stick to a MOOC or avoid getting distracted online - and when you're in college I can hazard a guess and say that self-discipline faces severe competition for its attention.

So. No judgements. But what do you do when you bunk class?

I tended to only bunk morning classes as I suck at waking up woke. Sometimes, I'd miss an afternoon class if we ended up getting bombed during lunch break though I'd usually just attend it bombed.

 The worst thing about this reservation is that the government thinks job is just a one-way monthly income to the worker. The government never thinks of the quality of the work / importance of having merit do the job. This has the potential to irrepairably damage the standard of education / health and government services. Probably when an MP would have to get operated on by a non-meritous SC / ST surgeon they would know.

They should keep STEM merit based and away from reservation. How much empowerment does one need before feeling empowered? Apparently, not even after having a job.

I fail to see the rationale behind this. When in opposition, these sanghis would have called such a move ""appeasement"". I guess party with a difference is only different in terms of having a forked tongue.

I'm not even getting into merits of reservations in promotions- if designed properly, those would help counter the inherent bias within the system. However, knowing how spectacularly""the most capable administrator in india"" botched gst implementation, by passing a law without thinking (one country, one tax, only in name), and implementing it without being prepared, i can bet that there hasn't been any thought beyond, ""how can we split the dalit vote?"" Yeah fuck that.  Fine as long as its clerical work.  But I don't want my chief of surgery to be an average student. Where merit matters,  relaxation of criteria shouldn't be there. It's not going to be a big problem if you promote a 95% percent scoring SC/ST guy over a 97% general,  but not very good for general public when a general guy with all India rank 20,000 doesn't get admission to a govt medical college but a scst student who didn't even qualify for the admission has been admitted because there weren't any candidates from that caste who scored more than 50th percentile.

**SC, ST quota in promotion: Narendra Modi government takes this big decision** 

 ______ 
The move comes following a recent verdict by the Supreme Court in this regard.
(PTI)

The Centre today asked all its departments and the state governments to
implement reservation in promotion for employees belonging to Scheduled Caste
(SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) categories. The move comes following a recent
verdict by the Supreme Court in this regard. The Personnel Ministry, in an
order, said, “The cadre controlling authorities of Central government
ministries, departments and Union territories are to carry out promotions in
accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court.” Every promotion order
must clearly mention the stipulation that the promotion shall be subject to
further orders which may be passed by the Supreme Court, it said. According to
the order, besides the Central government departments concerned, state
governments are also advised to take necessary action in this matter.

The personnel ministry order will be applicable to SC and ST category
employees working with the Centre and the state governments, an officer said.
The apex court had on June 5 allowed the Centre to go ahead with reservation
in promotion for employees belonging to the SC and ST category in “accordance
with law”.

The top court took into account the Centre’s submissions that entire process
of promotion has come to a “standstill” due to the orders passed by various
high courts and the apex court had also ordered for “status quo” in a similar
matter in 2015. “We will say you (Centre) can go ahead with promotion in
accordance with law,” a vacation bench comprising Justices Adarsh Kumar Goel
and Ashok Bhushan had told Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Maninder Singh,
representing the Centre.

During the hearing, the ASG cited the case laws on the issue of quota in
promotion in government jobs and stated that the apex court’s 2006 judgement
in M Nagaraj case would be applicable. The M Nagaraj verdict had said that
creamy layer concept cannot be applied to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes for promotions in government jobs like two earlier verdicts of 1992
Indra Sawhney and others versus Union of India (popularly called Mandal
Commission verdict) and 2005 E V Chinnaiah versus State of Andhra Pradesh,
which dealt with creamy layer in Other Backward Classes category.

On November 15 last year, a three-judge bench of the apex court had agreed to
consider whether its 11-year-old judgement in M Nagaraj case was needed to be
re-visited. The nine-judge bench of Supreme Court had, in the Indira Sawhney
case in 1992, permitted reservation for the SCs and STs in promotion to
continue for a period of five years from November 16, 1992.

***The move comes following a recent verdict by the Supreme Court in this regard.*** 

But Modi ""did it"" ... /s

 ""Why are Indians settling in abroad?"" Sab Ka Sath. Sub ka Vikas The rationale behind this move seems to be to counter the domination of upper castes in certain posts like that of secretary in a ministry. There was a study done in 2013 which showed that out of 150 posts of secretary, there were 0 SC's and about 3 ST's. Its unimaginable that out of 150 posts the govt/establishment wasnt able to find even 1 SC IAS officer for a secretary level post. 

Even today you can take a look at the secretaries from the important ministries and you'll find a majority of them are from the upper castes.

Reservation in promotion makes the concept of reservation more meaningful. A lot of deputations are decided upon the discretion of the govt/minister. No marks for guessing which group gets the maximum bulk of those posts.

If sitting a warm room on an uncomfortable bench for 2 hours, depressed and not understanding anything is negatively affecting their morale and IQ then why shouldn't they complain?? It's a genuine problem. 

If students don't want to sit for certain classes then that should be on the teachers not the students.

Here's a piece where two professors, Dunkin Jalki and Sufiya Pathan, are debunking the stats on how crime against SCs supposedly increased by 746%.

Read the entire piece for all the details.

https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/have-crimes-against-scs-and-sts-increased-of-late-here-are-the-facts/1147315/

> A website named Indiaspend, which calls itself the “country’s first data journalism initiative”, and aspires to be the “agency of record when it comes to data and facts” recently ran a sensational cover story about the rise in crime rates against Dalits in India. It claimed that its analysis of data from National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) indicated a sharp rise in crimes against Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) and that the crime rates against the communities had jumped eight times (746%) and 12 times (1,160%) respectively in the past decade.

> ...

> And then Indiaspend realised it had bungled? The authors of the article, in their enthusiasm to play up caste atrocities, had compared entities with different denominators to make the claim. They regretted their error, attributing it to the change in NCRB’s methodology. What they did not mention in their regret message though was that they had misquoted the report. They changed a few things in the article, importantly the claim of 746% increase in crime rates against Scheduled Castes was changed to 25% increase and 1,160% increase in crime rates against Scheduled Tribes was changed to a 9% decrease after their new calculations. But many errors were left as they were and a new title was chosen, cherry-picking another number so that the original narrative of a steep rise in caste atrocities remained intact and the article was salvaged.

> ...

>  For example, in the time period that we are told the crime rate against Scheduled Castes increased by 25% (was 746%), the rate of overall crimes as reported under Indian Penal Code (IPC) increased by more than 39% and the rate of violent crimes against all Indians went up by more than 45%. So, if the crime rates against Scheduled Castes have increased at a lesser rate as compared to the overall increase in crime rates, is it justified to talk of a rise in crime rates against SCs?

> ...

> If we were to consider the rate of all the violent crimes together we get the values of crime rates as 39.46, 10.9 and 4.36 for the overall population, SCs and STs respectively. The crime rates imply that both SCs and STs face at least several times lesser violent crimes than the average of 39.46 for the overall population. So, people belonging to the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe in India, the data tells us, face lesser violence and have a far lesser chance of being a victim of violent crimes such as murder, rape, and kidnapping than others. I think while the site is a good attempt, it's also  biased in it's tone. 

Would have preferred a neutral tone and leave it to the reader to conclude. Also, there are no successes at all?

 I was fuming with rage as I was going through the content, thinking how this person has still got followers.

Interesting thing, american politics is also going through an almost similar phase (see [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8mfhry/comment/dznj39u?context=3) comment).

  
 This is pretty one sided. For one, doesn't talk about urbanization or electrification. For this kind of analysis to be accepted by ppl you need to also discuss the positives of which there certainly are some. 

Also, If i were to throw absurd stats to prove a very unrelated  point i would soon be out of a job. For ex- How is militry casualty rate an indication of terrorism funding? Plz don't promote data butchery. 

 I am not a supporter of BJP. I am a data guy.  The website doesnt mention any positive steps in the past four years. Did the governement literally did nothing good? Even the worst governments of the country have been credited with some good developments. Whoever made this, great job man. Nicely made >Nepal blockade in 2015

What was that?  Bhai tune to nanga kar diya kaka ko I would like to see the stats on job creation / unemployment before Modi govt. Came to power. And also the effect of the ever growing population of the country on it.  Seems like OP is too serious,

Made is so perfect More like PartisanModiReportCard.com. Cherry-picking facts and present it as an honest report card is not much unlike fake news. Why not highlight infrastructure achievements and good policy changes if you want to give an unbiased account? We love to disparage right-wing, don't we? But never do we realise that we fall for the same tactics just as easily.  This trend on cow related lynchings/deaths,

Good luck! I thought caste no longer existed in cities /s

Funny how the OBC girl was open-minded... for the castes above her.  OP, just invite me to your wedding, that's all I care about.

PS: I'm from okayish caste, not too high, not too low. Any caste generally means that they are okay with people of higher caste contacting them.  So ""open minded"" is my caste plus caste considered above mine. Matrimonial sites are hilarious and sad. 

just a thought, you are still 27 why hurry?  There was a gilded comment by a black guy a few days ago that said that he really appreciated when the bullets dogdged him for a change.  This is the same.  Unfortunately Indian matrimonial sites is just online aunty network without the aunties. There will be the same BS except it's online. 

Take some time out and start dating. In the grand scheme of things, finding the right person is as important as JEE. * **Any caste** means **any equal or higher caste**

Educated ""modern"" broad-minded Indian _hypocrites_.

OP, you dodged a bullet with every one of those.

Marry a girl who, as they say, ""loves you at your worst"". You are lucky you got matches. My friend (bengali upper caste) from IIM didn't get any matches when he didn't mention caste in his matrimonial profile 5 years ago. This is what modern day un-touchability looks like >  IIM passout

> working in a well known consulting firm 

>earning about 30LPA

> sincere, hardworking, simple dude

>Got 99.4 %ile in CAT

> AIR in 600's general in IITJEE

>Telugu 

*stops reading* IIM does not teach you that Indians are hypocrites of the first order? SC guy here, top educational institution and worked for top companies but not an IIT/IIM guy.

When I got married, the first line of my profile was I am an SC, dont believe in Reservation that benefits only the creamy layer. Rest of the stuff, I was very transparent about what I was looking for - a no-nonsense girl who is non-hypocrite, non pretentious humanist. Caste/religion no bar.

Got fair number of interests from inside and outside my caste. It was hard to see people with matching academic background from an SC caste. The non-SC interests I received were mostly from other religions.

Married to a no-nonsense unpretentious smart girl, her parents are from a brahman + other religion mix. A couple of my close friends who married within their caste have said they wished their married life was as stable as mine, after interacting with my wife and me for a while.

Hang on dude. Fuck this shit. I'm so tired of people acting all ""modern"" on the outside and being a casteist, hater on the inside. This is just ridiculous. 

Dude hugs man. I mean what can I say, just know that if someone asks you your caste they're not worth your time.  [removed] [deleted] [deleted] Lesson no 1. Those who developed a thinking that girls are some magical creatures and are very innocent and caring should know that they are human and just like men are in general shitty. Also given the chance they can act even worse than men and they do.

Lesson no 2. जात कुछ जाती नही

Caste never goes away.

Women at the time of arranged marriage will prefer someone from their caste only no matter how ""open minded,Liberal or progressive they claim to be""

The reason for this? All those lables are to fit in socially and nothing else.

Lesson no 3. Everyone's hypocritical. Some will admit maximum won't. That doesn't change the fact.  Shaadi ka laddu  ouch. some people just suck, OP.  This is just sad.

As much as I hate to say this, you should mention your caste on matrimony sites cos ppl do judge you based on caste and this unfortunately is the reality of India. Better to keep the hypocrites at bay. 

My parents had an inter-caste marriage. That being said, it is a fact there are differences in upbringing (type of food, type of interests etc.) and general attitude/mentality of people ( pet peeves, biases, dinner convos etc.) of families belonging to different castes. This isnt that big a deal if the couple plans to stay away from parents and love each other enough to get over the differences in mentality. But these differences cause a lot of issues when the couple decides to stay with either set of parents. Especially for the wife. I know my mom suffered a bit in her early days since she is from a lower caste compared to my dad, similar thing happened with one of my aunts. My dad stood by my mom and both of them were working and earning so things worked out eventually, my aunt ended up divorcing my uncle.

An upper caste friend of mine married an SC guy and her parents all but abandoned her, her husband's parents were somewhat accepting but issues did creep in over the years and now the couple are staying in a different city.

My advice would be to find a girl who is willing to relocate and not overly attached to parents/family or someone who has stayed abroad or has had a parent who has worked/stayed abroad. In those scenarios the caste issue will likely get diluted Whoa, from Tinder directly to a matrimony website? Matrimonials suck. Every move is carefully considered joint action of atleast 3 people. It’s almost a business transaction. 
Go out, date, dance, flirt. You’ll have fun and find someone who likes you for who you are.  What are you so busy doing that you dont have time to do that. Priorities, man. You are being honest in India, mate. Won't work unless she is 1 in a million, who literally doesn't care. 

Ride solo instead. 🤘 i don't know if its true for most grills , but All of the grills i know never married below their so called ""caste strata"", but i know many guys who have relationships/marriages without a fuss about this. All the best OP, you will find a wonderful bride. Till then collect stories to publish a nice entertaining book. it shouldnt be TIFU but the others who f****** up by rejecting you based solely on caste. Good for you... I suggest leave this AM madness and look for someone who actually likes you!  So even a guy earning 30 lpa with IIT-IIM tag can't get over his caste when it comes to marriage 

Why are you not marrying within your community though ??  Damn! That is really sad to read. This must be really hurting for you.
I am SC too and nowhere near OP's financial and education status. I guess, I should start worry about marriage now. 

 I don't get the fuss around castes. I don't know the caste of my ex, I don't know the castes of my best friends, and I couldn't even be bothered to ask. It's an irrelevant label given to people that people don't even get to choose! Telugu people are casteist AF, no ? even here on randia caste feelings about marraige are pretty strong, people got triggered when sometime back i had suggested (after ambedkar) that people should marry outside their caste for eradicating caste system. but seems that caste runs too deeply in the indian psyche Wow i never knew caste is such a huge issue even in urban  areas. I know for a fact that I'm OBC (because 10th board forms. Never knew what my caste is), but I never knew what my exact caste is, since we never used the reservation. 
This discrimination is just saddening. Thank God I'm gay! >Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE.

Go to Europe. Get cool job. Get white girl. They don't know what SC is. why not post this on /r/tifu thread? i mean a lot of foreigners comming here to experience religion should know what they are buying into. What you're facing is ""did not read the instructions carefully"". Indian people don't read instructions on a hazardous item also. Let alone a marriage profile.

And like others have said -- (though you are wasting time), you are saving yourself from hypocrites. This is sick. I hope you find someone good yourself than through this arranged marriage business. Good luck. Such is reality. But keep an open mind and don't give up and weeding out the assholes is easier at this phase than at a later stage -from a person in a similar situation as you Wow ! Great(?) experience, keep track of your experiences till you meet your wife and write a book. One day it can become a movie ! :) This is the saddest thing I have read today. What the fuck people.  Caste is well alive even in urban India. No matter what you get or achieve in your life, you will be always judged by your caste and color. Nothing can change this mentality. I think it happens for your good, can you imagine marry such narrow-minded girl? You saved yourself bro. keep trying on tinder! Lol see the down votes. 
Good Luck OP but I think 27 is too early to get married. Haha this is so funny and so fucked up. ""Incredible india"" This is so sad and disturbing if narrated events are True. I can understand if less educated villagers are caste conscious but highly educated professionals from Metro have such mindset? Shocked and appalled. Perhaps, I was mistaken that people get enlightened with education. [deleted] caste system can't be broken by sustaining the system. you have anyway rejected the reservations that you were provided, for which i respect you. so, i don't see why you should still be hanging onto a demeaning label that somebody else gave your ancestors. just make up a caste of your own and don't call yourself an SC. as far as i know, there is no law preventing you from creating a caste of your own. My best friend a SC is dating a Brahmin. I remember her mother found out and she told her he will never marry you, no higher casts would accept a SC daughter-in-law. Her mother was right. My friend is the daughter to two civil servants. Still this is the status quo.  So no one is talking about 30LPA. OP sorry for your condition, but being a dick that I m, would like sharing your CAT prep strategy.

Obligatory caste notification, Dont know the caste but I m a fucking Tribal  from Bihar and do look like one.

EDIT : Also do invite me to your wedding if you dont mind a tribal in your wedding If you don't mind me asking kaun jaat ho? I mean which caste?

Why I am asking is because most northies including Maharatrians won't know the Telugu caste hierarchy unless you tell them. 

So you can either say bluntly that you are SC or you can tell them in a softer fashion that your caste is classified as SC but it isn't comparable to northie hierarchy and also highlight your own achievements. I mean soften the blow.

Now I am going to  be criticised for what I said above as it's playing the caste game and not taking the high road. However caste is a reality. Also you have chosen arranged marriage route so you can't escape it. Also your own post starts with claming you aren't stereotyptocal SC and you want to play up that card.  Soceital attitudes that makes one cringe. Racism (Skin-color), casteism, or communalism (religion) - these attitudes are programmed into us by an earlier generation , consciously or unconsciously. Its our choice if we want to *work at* eliminating them from our psyche - these are like layers of an onion - impossible to cast off in one go.  

Being in contact with diverse people can of course speed up the unlearning. You're fucking better off bro. You're killing it professionally (and you can only go up from here) and you're obviously intelligent and well educated. I'm not saying this to lift your spirits or whatever, you don't need that shit. What I'm saying is, if these people want to cling to archaic bullshit, let them. They may think you're beneath them but they're wrong. You outclass them by far. You do you bruh. I will die alone someday because I am of lower caste too minus the IIM pass out and fat paycheck stuff.

I once passed out in front of a college so I guess that counts :D Dude, what do you expect in India? It's uniformly hypocritical. Live and learn, I guess. **becuase there is a caste system , there's so much of reservation** 
Now , why do you want to curb down the 49% that the general category has ? 
I'm against the part where they allow them to take a general seat . 
I know reservation can't be eliminated fully , atleast not in the near future  Matrimonial sites are cancer. Avoid them at all costs. It's better to get fixed by relatives. Maybe I don't really understand the issues of the SC/ST but why would you actively identify with something that has kept you and your people down for so long? You could have just said you were buddhist and have lived without a caste for the last 3 generations.

You could have been happily married by now OP but instead you would rather everyone know that you're part of a victimized subjugated interest group. > I figured I was ready to get married.

How ya figure that? long time no sex? I wanna know coz me 26.  You have worked hard for everything in life, work a little bit more for that SO, who accepts everything from you.  Teli? Isn't that Jewish? You got jebaited.... :/ Bullet dodged like Neo from the Matrix, OP! Congrats and good luck in your spouse-hunt! As far as my experience goes - Even girls who are 'liberal' (  fuck around) mostly end up with with guys from their own caste only  Arranged marriage is a fucked up process, OP. If it is any consolation, I'm from an upper caste and I explicitly mentioned that I don't give a fuck about caste on my matrimonial profile only to face rejection from both upper and lower castes. 
I was dumped by my gf of 2 years the moment her parents found out I'm a different caste and went on to emotionally blackmail her. Mind you, her caste is lower than mine. She even had this super liberal JNU feminist personality facade about her. Imagine my heartbreak when she jumped on the first opportunity to get hitched to an UPSC job guy her parents introduced to her. Her parents' main objection? My caste. IIM is one caste i like. haha. Can i send my matrimonial page link for you to check? Let meknow [deleted] You said you never used reservation. Here's a take on why people don't : when you're eligible in the general category too , you use  the 'general' seat so that a seat in reservation remains empty , so someone else who got a lower rank can get that benefit. That's how general seats get eaten up. That's not something to be proud of , actually !  > lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE

For non reserved candidates, that just makes it worse... putting salt on a wound. >AIR in 600's general


So you chose not to pick a better course at a better IIT using your quota? If you didn't, you're stupid. If you did, you did actually make use of the reservations benefits


There's no need to be this smug and patronizing. Marriages are social contracts, it involves adapting yourself to your spouse's family/culture in varying degrees. If someone's not fond of a certain group of people, ofcourse theyre not going to marry into that caste. 

Also, different castes have different track records with status of women. So if an upper caste woman refuses to marry a guy from a largely illiterate lower caste, it is very much understandable since chances are very high her freedom is going to be severely curtailed. Did you find any girls who were fine with your caste but felt family wont approve? Did you suggest any to try to discuss about your caste with their family?  Which IIM ? When did you pass out? Where do you work now? 
Edit: why the hate? Just want to make friends Why the fuck would someone WANT to marry below his or her social strata if given the choice? ",1513151163.0,1,268,0,344,"Sorry for the dramatic title. Also as TIFUs usually go, this did not happen today but over a period of a month

A little background, I'm a 27 year old male, IIM passout. working in a well known consulting firm earning about 30LPA. I am a sincere, hardworking, simple dude. Since most caste related discussions always end up about reservation, lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE. But here's the catch, despite being a Telugu SC, apparently I don't look like one. I am light-skinned and have good facial features I guess.

So I figured I was ready to get married. Since I had no luck on Tinder and was extremely busy to go out and find someone, I created a profile on one of those matrimony websites for professionals because I want an educated, broad-minded working wife. MISTAKE #1. Most of the profiles on there were of girls from highly educated backgrounds and thats the reason I thought I could find someone like me whom I could connect with in terms of principles, attitude toward education/work/life, my agnostic beliefs etc.

I checked the 'Any' option on caste as it doesn't matter to me and figured since this is a place for educated professionals, nobody really cares about caste. MISTAKE #2.

So within a week, I get a fair amount of matches. Some are handled by parents, some handled by the girls themselves. Here are some interesting experiences I had over a period of a month:

1) **Telugu Unkil**: Caste mentioned - Kapu. Says he is ""highly interested"" in my profile. I mail him back saying if he has any caste preferences and that I prefer open-minded people in general. Writes back saying how his daughter is very broad-minded, hates traditional mindset and they are looking for a very liberal family. I think great, I would like to know more about her and we started talking on whatsapp and we seem to hit it off pretty well. 5 days later she asks me my caste and I mention it. Ghosted. No replies, she unfriends me on facebook, blocks me on whatsapp. I move on.


2) **Gril**: Works for a big bank in Mumbai. Mentions 'Any' caste. So I think great. I message her and she accepts it. We exchange numbers and start talking. A week goes by, we have talked about our jobs, future plans, location preferences and want to schedule a personal meetup. She messages me - ""hey I think you should know this, I am from Teli caste which is OBC. Hope your parents are ok?"" I tell her I don't care and neither do my parents. Then I tell her about my caste, and she starts acting weird. Starts replying to my texts in syllables and tries to hang up on my calls. I feel bad and message her asking what ticked her off. She says that she thought I was from an upper caste and that's why she replied to my message. And now she doesn't want to proceed any further and want to cancel all further plans. I told her that it's a bit hypocritical of her that initially she was one wanting my parents to be ok with her being OBC when she thought I was from OC. 


3) **Marathi Auntie**: This one's a bit hilarious. She sends me a message saying she really liked my profile for her daughter. I look it up and sure enough - mentioned 'any caste'. I give her my number and she sends me a complete biodata about her daughter. Daughter is really pretty and from MDI Gurgaon, I think great. But she mentions caste as 'Rigvedi Brahmin'. I think oh f**k. I send her all the details, mention my caste and even bracket it with '(SC)'. Immediately she goes, ""I really like your profile. Tell me the next steps or give me your parents number"". I'm like - this can't be happening. Then it hits me that maybe she has glanced over the caste part in her hurry. So I send another text saying,- ""ma'am pls confirm that you have seen my caste, and it falls under Scheduled Caste"". Never heard back from her.


There are a few more like this. Most of the profiles message me about my caste and go silent when I mention it. I realized that all my life, my circle of friends have ranged from all castes, religions and financial backgrounds and they never made me feel like a dalit or whatever. I have lived a happy and fairly successful life. That was the reason I was ignoring the caste aspect for finding someone to spend my life. 

Now I have learnt my lesson and changed my caste to clearly say SC and will stick to my own I guess. I also feel like giving up on these matrimony websites. It's been a great learning experience about my position in the society folks! :)",TIFU by being from a Scheduled Caste but apparently not looking like one
263,Scheduled,"Meanwhile most tamilnadu politicians are figuring out whose feet they have to prostrate on.  Why do you guys always forget, my personal favorite state **Kerala**????





I sure hope they don't come here in Karnataka.  TN, Kerala, Bengal, AP, Telangana. Where do guys you think will BJP rise first?  You never know. Tamilnadu is a different ball game because of anti hindi sentiment it holds. But as years go and Tamils get integrated with other Indians easily, national parties can have their footprints there. Even congress has miserable presence in Tamilnadu even though this party is the oldest party of India. Another great artwork: https://i.imgur.com/VCJDx6g.jpg Let [BJP get more votes than NOTA](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/rk-nagar-bypoll-results-nota-gets-more-votes-than-bjp-candidate-4997296/) in the State of TamilNadu before even dreaming of winning an Assembly seat there. Tamilnadu still vote based on caste and BJP is considered to be upper caste party and people who consider themselves as upper in Tamilnadu is 3%. Lol Periyar baiting is a common sanghi tactic so good choice. Unfortunately, TN needs another Periyar to truly be progressive. It won't be in power in Andhra too they say it won't happen here Good luck doing it here in Bengal.  Don't forget West Bengal too.  Being a north Indian who was brought up in Tamil Nadu for 24 years. I can safely say the north vs south hate is restricted to frustrated souls on internet who have nowhere but reddit/forums to relieve their frustrations. 
 The Problem is rural Tamils don't even know what BJP is, their leaders are mostly used by Tamil Memes Creators. The ideology of Periyar and Anna has in-grossed into minds of Normal Tamils, its highly unlikely they form power in TN. I wish BJP pose a serious threat to Political Parties here so that the Periyarian Ideology takes root in TN again. BJP's only competition is NOTA.  Tamil nadu has their own version of extremist policy BJP haven't set foot in AP either? it has been ruled either by CONG or Telugu parties. only reason there is a join is for state to have central ministers in the cabinet. I don't think they have any sway in how AP is run. All that TN needs is some movie star to tell them what to do next.  The Periyar's first-world state TN's record

[Tamil Nadu leads in crimes against dalits](https://m.timesofindia.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-leads-in-crimes-against-dalits/amp_articleshow/60077686.cms)

Another point which is seldom discussed is not being Hindutuva vote-bank & lack of Muslim hate on the ground do not mean by default the people of the state are progressive. In TN context dalits are the Muslims.Not a day goes by  where dalits don't get raped,murdered ,assaulted for using streets meant for OBCs in villages,etc., Somehow this   doesn't create as much outrage  as the eternal punching bags (for Indian media&randia) North Indian states. This [brutal incident where a 13 year old girl dalit girl raped, her 8 year old brother murdered](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/villupuram-horror-8-year-old-boy-killed-mother-assaulted-and-sister-allegedly-raped-76923)  and her mother assaulted would  find its way into international headlines if it was in North Indian states. 


Anyone who observed  TN politics would agree that [TN only succeeded in supplanting Brahmin with  mid-caste hegemony](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/brutal-atrocities-against-dalits-tamil-nadu-colossal-failure-dravidian-edifice-32455).There are no upper castes in TN like Rajputs,Nairs. Brahmin-shudra(dominant peasantsOBCs)-dalits.  Reason why they are easily sold on Dravidian ""victimhood"" politics. Their politics centers on victim complex.Blame ""Aryan"" invaders aka brahmins&north Indians for everything and close the matter,do not self correct and introspect. That is what periyar and other Dravidian leaders taught them(Tamils aka OBCs). 

As this Dalit writer observes [Periyar&Dravidian  only worked for non-brahmin,non-dalit feudal castes](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/periyars-hindutva/225056). He called Dravidian politics as Periyar's hindutuva (OBC tuva). 

All the whining you hear regarding ""Tamilan daww"" ""Tamila culture"" are from the OBCs. Since they are 80% they set the narrative ,their problem becomes pan Tamil problem. 

As to why BJP couldn't make inroads into TN ,  the clue lies in caste. 


1.BJP made inroads into states which had historical record of standing upto invasions. 


2.The OBCs(80% of TN) wouldn't let go of their power by joining national stream. using this Tamil victimhood they could whip up paranoia and get what they wanted (like exemption from NEET to conveniently hide the fact TN students are unfit to clear the exam bcos their [board is utter shit](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/explainer-how-neet-has-exposed-standard-science-education-tamil-nadu-66529) even for Indian standards  ) 

coming to # 1,Tamils have little to no history of standing upto Invasions .So there is no emotional attachment to religion(Hinduism)& country. CASTE is supreme.   From 13th century ,when the pandyan kingdom was defeated by kafur ,only non-Tamils (sultans, Marathas, Telugu(Naiks),Kannada,Vijayanagara,French British) have been ruling Tamil country until the republic of India was formed and kamraj was made Madras state's  CM(for Dravidian propaganda machine  brahmin Rajaji  is not a  Tamil).

Even in British India there was no opposition on a large scale to the British in Tamil country.   A Victorian historian noted : 

*“That the sepoys of the Madras Army have not   revolted is simply because the Tamul [sic] races to which they belong have no   literature, no traditions, or none worthy of the name, no pride of ancestry,   no country in fact and no caste.”* Quarterly Review of 1858 (volume   103)


In 20th century the Dravidian politicians sided with the British empire. Periyar vehemently opposed independence ,he begged the British to rule Madras presidency at least from London.   This was the resolution passed in the first non-brahmin meeting 

*[We are deeply devoted and loyally attached to British rule](http://www.frontline.in/cover-story/how-the-fort-was-captured/article6328529.ece)*  

 If Kerala , Karnataka and Tamil Nadu stay together they can remove all the dirt... He isn't too popular in these parts... Wonder why? Yes, it means BJP is taking assistance of local parties to form NDA; doesnt mean the other way arround that BJP having a sway. I hope we dont need that ignorant Chauvinist's ideology to counter BJP's  As someone suggested it is TIME , we need leaders like periyar in every indian state. He was not only a great rationalist , his ideologies and thoughts were beyond his time period. TN wouldnt be the same if not for him. Most of the political parties arose and still arise from his ideology .

Wish southern states stand up against religious parties and promote those who stand for development in this scientific era.

Atleast in the foreseeable future , i dont see BJP setting foot , leave alone winning in TN. Their representatives are the buffons in TN political arena.

The ADMK which is puppeted by BJP will not be there after next election.  Peace

 Hindi is practically given more importance than other regional languages. BJP is the symbol of Hindi belt. Pon Radhakrishnan can win one seat. That's all BJP can ever do here. ADMK is just the proxy party of BJP. So is Rajinikanth. Both the parties will be thrown out soon. Periyar, an old communist hag who married his own daughter is a hero in tamil state.  Meh. A couple of free pressure cookers and bicycles, and tamilians will be eating rice off the street for Modi, BJP represents the colossal failure of Hindi and hindutva in being useful to india. As long as that's the case so will BJP in TN. People of TN should watch out for saffron propagandists, masquerading as archaeologists and literary experts, and seeking to distort Tamil history in every possible manner.

Since most of the comments have already answered your question. Let me share an interesting point from an [article](https://eightytwentyinvestor.com/2018/03/11/dude-shall-i-cut-my-equity-exposure/) i got from that sub recently.

That's how markets work, stick for the long haul (10+ years) and you'll reap it's benefits! You have essentially invested when the market was at all time peak and started comparing when markets started slow downward slide in last month or so. Even the best funds show negative results for short span of time of 3 months including a peak and a dip. 

Keep on investing small amounts and check only over long periods of time. At least 3 or 6 months to readjust your SIP's yearly. are you stupid op? the entire market has gone down in the last 3 months. what does that have to with scripbox? You chose to invest at a wrong time. You probably invested at the top.

>I subscribed to Scripbox 3 months ago

Indian market has been doing shit all since two months(following the US market) and maybe the next next leg of downturn has started. So scripbox is doing nothing magical but following the market.

the best bet for a lay investor who is not timing the market is SIP.. 6% drawdown in last 3 months seems par for the course given how markets have fared. No fault lies with scripbox here. Don't stop your lont term investments after 3 months.

Although, I would suggest moving to Direct plans instead of regular. Head over to /r/indiainvestments and go through the wiki. are you investing in regular plan with scripbox ? switch to direct plan  Always benchmark your portfolio against a similar investment in the index.. Your portfolio should outperform the index at least 70% of the time to make good the higher costs and selection risk

**Haryana To Send 5,000 People On Free Varanasi Pilgrimage** 

 ______ 
Manohar Lal Khattar said that about 300 schemes were being implemented by
various departments (File)

**Kaithal, Haryana: **

5,000 people from Haryana would go on a free tour of Kashi, as the city of
Varanasi is popularly known, under a state government scheme, Haryana Chief
Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said today.

He also announced that from next year an 'Antyodaya Karyalaya' would be set up
in every sub-division of the state. In these offices, information will be
provided to people about the various welfare schemes, he said.

Mr Khattar also announced an increase in the annual income limit from Rs 2.5
lakh to Rs four lakh under the 'Medhavi Chhatra Protsahan Yojana', a decision
that would benefit about 15,000 students.

According to an official statement, he said that a provision of 10 per cent
reservation would be made in jobs under Outsourcing Policy Part I and II,
which would be increased in the next phase.

As many as 5,000 people would be given benefit of free tour to Kashi,
birthplace of Shri Ravidas Ji, on first come first serve basis, he said
according to the release.

Mr Khattar made these announcements at an event held to celebrate the 641st
Jayanti of Guru Ravidas Ji here.

He said that about 300 schemes were being implemented by various departments
but people did not know about all of them, therefore, Antyodaya Karyalayas
would be a blessing.

Mr Khattar also said that a provision was being made under which an on
organization would be deputed to ensure that funds under the Scheduled Caste
component of a department were utilized completely.

Earlier the funds under the Scheduled Caste component remained unused and
lapsed, he said.

He said that to ensure employment to each youth in the state, DRI Advance of
about Rs 200 crore would be provided to youth through banks to set up their
own ventures and the four per cent interest rate would be borne by the state
government.

Employment, whether in private sector or government, has so far been provided
to about 1.75 lakh youth in the state, the statement said.

Mr Khattar said the state government was carrying out the recruitment to about
300 backlog posts reserved for Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes of five
categories.

Attacking the Congress, the chief minister said the people had not forgotten
the atrocities committed on Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes during the
previous government's term.

The incidents of Gohana and Mirchpur are still alive in the conscious of
people, he said.

Haryana Transport Minister Krishan Lal Panwar said Prime Minister Narendra
Modi had a vision to provide housing to all by 2022 and these houses would be
provided to three lakh people in the state in next five years under Bhimrao
Ambedkar Awas Yojana'.

Education Minister Ram Bilas Sharma said the Haryana government would organize
a state level function in Bhiwani to celebrate Ravidas Jayanti on February 4.

__ Comments

Minister of State for Welfare of Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes Krishan
Kumar said the present chief minister had given full respect and honour to the
people belonging to Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes.

Mr Khattar also laid foundation stones and inaugurated 16 projects to the tune
of about Rs 50 crore.

**More Than 19,500 Languages Spoken In India: Census** 

 ______ 
96.71 per cent population in India have one of the 22 scheduled languages as
their mother tongue.

**New Delhi: **

More than 19,500 languages or dialects are spoken in India as mother tongue,
according to the latest analysis of a census released this week.

There are 121 languages which are spoken by 10,000 or more people in India,
which has a population of 121 crore, it said.

The Registrar General and Census Commissioner, India, said since a household
may consist of persons related by blood or of unrelated persons or a mix of
both, it is absolutely necessary to ask every person about her or his mother
tongue.

It was required because the mother tongue of each member of a household need
not necessarily be the same -- these may be different for different members in
the household.

The number of such raw returns of mother tongue has totalled 19,569, the
report of the 2011 census said.

However, 96.71 per cent population in the country have one of the 22 scheduled
languages as their mother tongue.

Since mother tongue, as returned in the census, is the designation provided by
the respondents of the linguistic mediums in which the respondents think they
communicate, they need not be identical with the actual linguistic mediums, it
said.

For assessing the correlation between the mother tongue and designations of
the census and for presenting the numerous raw returns in terms of their
linguistic affiliation to actual languages and dialects, 19,569 raw returns
were subjected to thorough linguistic scrutiny, edit and rationalisation.

This resulted in 1,369 rationalised languages and dialects as mother tongue
and 1,474 names which were treated as ""unclassified"" and relegated to ""other""
mother tongue category.

The 1,369 rationalised languages and dialects were further classified
following the usual linguistic methods for rational grouping based on
available linguistic information.

Thus, an inventory of classified mother tongue returned by 10,000 or more
speakers are grouped under appropriate languages at the all-India level,
wherever possible, has been prepared for final presentation of the 2011 mother
tongue data.

The total number of languages arrived at is 121, the Registrar General and
Census Commissioner, India, said.

The 121 languages are presented in two parts -- languages included in the
Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, comprising 22 languages and
languages not included in the Eighth Schedule, comprising of 99 languages plus
the category ""total of other languages"", which includes all other languages
which returned less than 10,000 speakers each at the all-India level or were
not identifiable on the basis of the linguistic information available.

The number of scheduled languages was 22 at the time of presentation of the
2001. The same 22 languages are maintained in 2011 census also.

The non-scheduled languages are 99 in 2011 against 100 in 2001. The decrease
in the number is due to exclusion of Simte and Persian, which were not
returned in sufficient numbers as 2011, and inclusion of Mao, which has
returned more than 10,000 speakers at the all-India level at 2011 census.

Of the total population of India, 96.71 percent have one of the scheduled
languages as their mother tongue, the remaining 3.29 per cent is accounted for
other languages.

There are total 270 identifiable mother tongues which have returned 10,000 or
more speakers each at the all-India level, comprising 123 mother tongues
grouped under the scheduled languages and 147 mother tongues grouped under the
non-scheduled languages.

Those languages and dialects which have returned less than 10,000 speakers
each and which have been classified under a particular language, are included
in ""others"" under that language.

The Eighth Schedule of the Constitution consists of the following 22 languages
--

Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Malayalam,
Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu,
Urdu, Bodo, Santhali, Maithili and Dogri.

Of these languages, 14 were initially included in the Constitution. Sindhi
language was added in 1967. Thereafter three more languages viz., Konkani,
Manipuri and Nepali were included in 1992.

__

Subsequently, Bodo, Dogri, Maithili and Santhali were added in 2004.

**Gujarat ranks third in number of honour killings** 

 ______ 
AHMEDABAD: In a revelation that runs contrary to Gujarat's so-called
progressive image, the state reported 30 cases of honour killings in three
years, the third highest number in the country. If the figures are adjusted
for population, Gujarat ranks fourth in the country in honour killings per
crore population, between 2014 and 2016.

The so-called model state lags just behind comparatively the underdeveloped
states of

Uttar Pradesh

and

Madhya Pradesh

, which had 148 and 39 cases of honour killing respectively, between 2014 and
2016. When adjusted for the population, Gujarat moves to the fourth spot,
after

Punjab

, where 21 cases were registered.

According to figures from the Union home ministry, Gujarat reported 2 cases of
honour killings in 2014, which rose to 21 cases in 2015. In 2016, the state
reported seven cases of honour killings under section 302 (murder) of the
Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Gujarat is far ahead of Haryana, which has a particularly regressive image due
to existence of khap panchayats there. Haryana reported six cases of honour
killing between 2014 and 2016, and is far behind the PM's home state when
figures are adjusted for population.

These figures are alarming especially as the state recently witnessed a spate
of incidents of 'shame killings' as perpetrators believed the victim would
bring shame or dishonour to them.

Gaurang

Jani

, a city-based sociologist, said the higher figures of UP and MP were because
those states have larger populations than Gujarat.

""Gujarat was never progressive in terms of caste and communal harmony and it
has never had an amicable environment for inter-religious and inter-caste
marriages with its history of horrific and frequent communal riots and two
anti-reservation agitations. The social structure of this state was never open
to reform,"" said Jani.

""We do not see marriages between so-called upper caste persons and so-called
lower caste persons. Besides, marriages between Hindus and Muslims are
targeted and face protests with the rising chorus about 'love jihad',"" added
Jani.

Jani said it is mainly the girls that are killed in honour killings by their
parents, to avert so called 'shame' on the family.

Gujarat home minister Pradipsinh Jadeja was not available for comment on the

**Indigo Goa-Hyderabad flight departs 'early', leaves 14 passengers behind** 

 ______ 
MUMBAI: Fourteen passengers who had boarding passes for an

Indigo Goa-Hyderabad

flight were left behind at Goa airport on Monday.

The stranded passengers alleged that the flight departed earlier than its
scheduled time without making any announcement.

An

Indigo

spokesperson countered their claims, saying that the airline made several
announcements calling the passengers to report at the gate.

Flight 6E 259 was scheduled for a 10.50pm departure yesterday, but left 25
minutes before the scheduled time according to the passengers.

The 14 passengers, who had their boarding passes and were waiting to board the
flight, were left behind unawares at the airport.

The flight's scheduled time of arrival in Hyderabad was 12.05am, but it landed
at 11.40pm.

An Indigo spokesperson said that the passengers were declared ""gate no-show"".

""The boarding gate closed at 10:25pm and they reached the gate at 10.33pm.
IndiGo staff looked for them at the airport while making frantic announcements
over hand-held loudspeaker,"" said the airline.

""They (staff) had called them on the phone number provided by the passengers,
but it turned out to be that of their travel agent,

Thomas Cook

, who refused to give us their phone numbers but promised that they will
inform the passengers,"" the spokesperson said adding that many other
passengers also witnessed the airline's efforts to search the passengers at
airport.

In the best interest of those who boarded on time, we closed the gates and
deplaned the passengers who reached late. ""Despite no fault on our part, we
shifted them to the next morning flight free of charge,"" the airline added.

The incident also raises the question whether IndiGo carried out ""passenger
baggage reconciliation"", a mandatory security norm which requires an airline
to check whether all the passengers who have checked in their bags are
onboard.

If any of the 14 passengers who were left behind had a check-in bag and the
aircraft left without the airline offloading that check-in bag, then it is a
breach of security.

**Caste decided by birth, can't be changed by marriage: SC** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: A person's caste is unalterable and can't change after marriage,
the Supreme Court said on Thursday, setting aside the appointment of a woman
teacher who joined Kendriya Vidyalaya 21 years ago taking benefit of
reservation on the ground that she was married to a Scheduled Caste man.

A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and M M Shantanagoudar said the woman, who has
now become vice-principal after serving two decades in the school, was not
entitled to the benefits of reservation as she was born in an upper caste
family and her caste remained so despite marrying into a Scheduled Caste
family.

""There cannot be any dispute that the caste is determined by birth and the
caste cannot be changed by marriage with a person of Scheduled Caste.
Undoubtedly, she was born in 'Agarwal' family, which falls in general category
and not in Scheduled Caste. Merely because her husband belongs to a Scheduled
Caste category, she should not have been issued with a caste certificate
showing her caste as Scheduled Caste,"" the bench said.

The woman was issued a caste certificate in 1991 by the district magistrate of
Bulandshahr certifying her as of Scheduled Caste. Based on the academic
qualifications and caste certificate, she was appointed as a Post Graduate
Teacher in 1993 at Kendriya Vidyalaya at Pathankot in Punjab. During the
course of her service, she completed her M.Ed.

Two decades after her appointment, a complaint was filed against her seeking
cancellation of her appointment, alleging she had illegally taken the benefit
of reservation without belonging to Scheduled Caste category. After conducting
an inquiry, authorities cancelled her caste certificate and Kendriya Vidalaya
terminated her job in 2015. Challenging KV's decision, she approached the
Allahabad HC which dismissed her plea, and upheld her termination. She then
approached the apex court for relief.

Taking into account her unblemished service of over two decades, the SC
modified the HC order and said the order of termination from service shall be
treated as the order of compulsory retirement. ""While exercising leniency, we
have also kept in mind that she has neither played fraud nor misrepresented
before authorities for getting the caste certificate... No questions were
raised against her till the complaint ... came to be lodged, even when the
authorities had seen the high school certificate, marksheet etc. showing her
caste as Agarwal..."" the bench said.

Tina Dabi and Athar Aamir Khan reportedly fell in love while undergoing
training in Delhi.

**New Delhi: **

Tina Dabi, the 24-year-old IAS officer w

ho topped the civil services exam

three years ago, and the man from Kashmir who came second in the same exams
are now married.

Ms Dabi, a Rajasthan-cadre officer who is now posted in Ajmer, tied the knot
with 25-year-old

Athar Aamir Khan

in south Kashmir's Pahalgam on Saturday. Families and friends of the young
power couple attended the wedding that took place at Pahalgam Club.

The groom's family hosted a reception in his hometown in Anantnag's Mattan on
Sunday.

Tina Dabi's mother is a former Indian Engineering Service (IES) officer.
(File)

According to reports, the two toppers fell in love when they were undergoing
training at the Department of Personnel and Training office in Delhi.

A graduate of Delhi's Lady Shri Ram college, Tina Dabi shot into limelight
after she became the first Dalit to top the prestigious civil services exam in
2015. She cleared the tough exams in her first attempt itself and secured just
little over 52 per cent marks. Athar Aamir Khan cleared the exams and came
second in his second attempt. In his first attempt in 2014, Mr Khan had got
into the railways and was undergoing training at the Railways Institute of
Transport Management in Lucknow.

__ Comments

Ms Dabi was born in Bhopal and did her schooling from Carmel Convent School.
Her mother is a former Indian Engineering Service (IES) officer and her father
Jaswant is a serving IES officer.

Soon after topping the tests,

Ms Dabi had said she wants to work for women empowerment in Haryana.

Athar Aamir Khan from Jammu and Kashmir cleared the UPSC exams in his second
attempt. (File)

Mr Khan, who did his Class 11 and 12 from Tyndale Biscoe School in Srinagar,
had made it to the IIT but did not join as he was offered a B-Tech course when
he wanted to pursue another branch of engineering. ""This also acted as a
catalyst for me to appear for the civil services and I qualified last year,""
he had said in 2016.

**A Gujarat repeat in Karnataka? On first leg of campaign, Rahul Gandhi likely to visit 4 religious places**

Written by

Updated: February 8, 2018 7:32 am

Congress president Rahul Gandhi will tour northernmost parts of Karnataka from
February 10 to 13 (Express Photo/Tashi Tobgyal/File)

The itinerary for Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s first-leg tour indicates
the party may continue with a strategy it adopted in the recent Gujarat polls
of subtly appealing to Hindu voters with temple visits by its chief
campaigner. Among key stops on the schedule are places with a Hindu temple,
two Lingayat religious centres, and a Muslim dargah.

Rahul is scheduled to tour the districts of Bellary, Koppal, Raichur, Yadgir,
Gulbarga and Bidar, in northernmost parts of the state, from February 10 to
13.

While state Congress leaders claim that no deliberate thought was given to the
religious stopovers, the nature of places chosen reveals careful planning.
Much of the territory Rahul will cover is inhabited by Lingayats, the single
largest community in Karnataka.

Followers of 12th century poet-saint Basaveshwara, Lingayats are identified as
Hindus and are the electoral base of BJP in the state — former chief minister
B S Yeddyurappa, BJP’s chief ministerial candidate and state unit chief, comes
from the community. The Lingayats are, however, currently engaged in an
internal battle for separation from Hindu religion, an effort that is seen to
have received subtle support from Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s Congress
government.

It is widely believed that the Congress will need to take away Lingayat votes
in north Karnataka from the BJP to stand a chance of returning to power.

The first religious stop designated for Rahul during the first leg of his tour
is at Huligamma Temple, a religious place more than a thousand years old in
Huligi village on the banks of Tungabhadra river in Koppal district. Durga is
believed to be manifested in the form of a rock there.

The second scheduled stop, at Gavisiddeshwara Mutt, is a prominent Lingayat
monastery in the same district, headed by the seer Abhinava Gavi Siddheshwara
Swami. The mutt is over 800 years old and has deep reach within villagers of
the region on account of its efforts at spiritual, educational and health
outreach.

Rahul is next scheduled to visit Khwaja Bande Nawaz dargah in Gulbarga
district. The dargah, mausoleum of the famous Sufi saint Khwaja Bande Nawaz,
is visited by people of all communities in the region.

The final religious stop, as per the itinerary, will be Anubhava Mantapa — at
Basavakalyan in Bidar district — a seat of religious thought and reflection
for the Lingayat community.

While announcing Rahul’s tour programme recently, State Congress president G
Parameshwara had said: “There are no scheduled visits to temples during the
first (leg of) visit. But if he is invited in an informal way to participate
in a temple ritual during his visit, he will participate. It is not a form of
soft Hindutva but inclusive Hindutva that we (Congress party) follow.”

The difficulty is somewhat on the easy side on the default difficulty but I don't want to wade into a higher difficulty without one vanilla playthrough and seeing what the different enemy types and weapons are. 

Also dipped into **battlefield 1**(singleplayer campaign only because *coughcough*) . The series had never interested me (my internet speeds had always been too shit for multiplayer) but the ww1 setting sure piqued my interest. The campaign is way too short but it's interesting to see far cry style stealth-through-bases gameplay (albeit too simplified) instead of missions where you can't even go ten steps away from the scripted path. The Lawrence of Arabia campaign was an aesthetic I longed to see in videogames for an eternity and it was decent enough(some real mgs tpp vibes). After hearing so much about it, I've begun playing **Kerbal Space Program**. 

It's...a lot more complicated than I thought it'd be. I'm also glad I'm not in charge of the ISRO.

I recently discovered a cool indie game called Foxhole on steam. It's gor a persistent war going on and manages to simulate war-time logistics quite well.  Just ended Rise of the Tomb Raider!
 Got really addicted to **Warframe**. This game is seriously amazing. Currently Mastery rank 7. Looking for some friends, ign- HuntingLion (yeah I really like the name :P ) Anyone playing **Paladins**? I'm 350 hrs into the game. It's pretty fun f2p. Playing **For Honor**. It's nice, when it works. buy it if you like fighting games. 1v1 and 2v2 are the best modes. Dont bother with 4v4 I'm quite shameless to admit that I only play Overwatch, though looking forward to Mass Effect Andromeda. Also have to play Dishonored 2, as the 1st was really fucking good. Installed bunch of Indie games and played few of them and sadly i stopped playing all of them in 4 hrs. 

Started with **Monaco** and after few mins i started to hate those colours. Made me dizzy. Uninstalled. 

Next up **Metal Slug 3** was playing the last mission and i had power cut. Saves gone :(. Uninstalled.

Next one **Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet**. Loved it initially. Then encountered boss fights. Defeated one and then encountered another boss. Failed 8 times. Raged quit. Uninstalled.

 Got Rise of Tomp Raider for Rs 400. Gifted one for an old friend too. Felt good.

Also got Humble Bundle Freedom. Crafted a shitload of badges on steam lol. It was something like 50 games. Darksouls 3 and the new Hitman.

Apparently the vault access is open in **Warframe**, so reinstalling that rn.

Has anyone played the **Telltale Batman** series? I have heard it's good but am still on the fence about buying it. Starting playing witcher 3 after steam sale...

It is a fun 2d action sidescroller with a decent story and plot. I am notably impressed by its artwork! Started playing Phoenix Wright on Drastic and I have to say it's a great game. Human Resource Machine is also fun and challenging. On another note, Deus Ex GO is available for ₹10 on Play Store.

EDIT: Check out Hitman GO and Lara Croft GO as well. I've been playing a lot of **ARMA 3** and recently came back to **Counter Strike Global Offensive** after a long hiatus.

For those interested in realistic combat/warfare simulation, I'd highly recommend picking up ARMA 3 over the Steam Winter Sale. Anyone play WarThunder?

All in all, well worth for the price and time. Borderlands 2 has a huge discount on steam.  My question is can I play coop?  After all these years do people play it? Anyone else wanna play with me?  I can't believe I have 91 games on steam. :)

That sounds cool (Hopefully I don't get banned)..

Back onto playing Skyrim with mods. Tried Skyrim SE, but somethings are broken. Not sure why. :/

Bought 3 games during steam sale, I wonder if I will ever try them... Looking to play a few games that could run on a 750M with 2GB of GDDR5. Any suggestions? I want to play Witcher 3 so bad but the experience will be piss poor. 

EDIT: Decent CPU: 2.5 Ghz I7-4870HQ.

Will Middle earth shadow of mordor run fine? Finishing shadow of Mordor dlc now. Also having fun with rocket league and CS go though the lag is frustrating. Got ac3 for free on Uplay and purchased Arkham Knight premium during winter sale.

My backlog is in excess of 250 games so I can hold off till summer. 

Glad that Paytm works finally.  just got back to *CS;GO* since i nu maal these days ;( I recently played **AntiChamber**. It's a mindfuck of a game. Short but a really great experience.

Also downloaded and played **Hearthstone**  for the first time this week in spite of never being a fan of TCG. It actually seems really fun. I am not that good at it but still having fun.
 on PS3, finished Assassin's Creed - II.

Picked up Borderlands-II Recently completed The Evil Within. It's a survival horror by the creator of resident evil, Shinji Mikami. The game is tough but worth playing if you're a fan of horror. I should mention that the optimization of the game is not great.
Currently, playing its DLC: The Assignment. Not to initiate console wars but, 

PS4 or PS4 Pro? 

Look, I don't have 4K TV, and this is a very belated birthday gift to my brother.  So your recommendations would be great. If I can share it with him, I will probably want to restart playing **Assassin's Creed 3** and continue the series. 

 I know gamers don't really like mobile games, but I played the second version of an old game **Hill Climb Racing 2** and it's just soo much better and fun! The Marion Run style multiplayer mode is amazing and worth a try.

Also, has anyone played **Don Bradman Cricket 17** yet? Waited for official launch of Pokemon Go, it's finally here. Walking 10+ km everyday because of it. But sadly no players around, also too few pokestops. Barcelona finally pass like they're Barcelona in FIFA 17.I love giving through balls in it.

Can anybody suggest a good city builder (apart from sim city or city skylines) or a good simulation game. Xbox One Gamer here, been playing The Division's survival for the past week, so far its has been a blast. Will be jumping into
World of Tanks too.   What old games can I play well on an Intel HD5500 8gb RAM? (other than notepad)  Gta 5 online is the best experience I've had a long with black ops 2. I suggest you find a couple of friends and just play the heists, it's very rewarding and fun. Except for the part where the game is 60% loading screens  Anyone play Guild Wars 2? Its a pretty casual game, unlike most MMOs.

Also, PvP season 5 is on right now which is pretty fun if you are into PvP. I just started The Book of Unwritten Tales. The game looks promising. It's a point-and-click game with a lot of the kind of humour where people say stupid shit which we know is stupid but they don't... except, it isn't stupid in the in-game universe, because it's actually fucking true there! Go figure, huh?  Summoner Wars. Very good game. :) Anyone play **the Binding of Isaac** here?

Currently playing the awesome community made mod Antibirth and holy shit it's awesome! Try it out if you like Isaac!

These two are easily the best gaming experiences I've had on phone. Currently I'm playing dead effect 2. While it's an interesting story and well made game and it's free too, what I hate about it is that unless you pay for credits and game money, its difficultly level is super high for me.

295,Scheduled,"> ... **Ambedkar and Periyar were at the forefront of social movements that challenged the deeply entrenched caste system, traced its origins to Hinduism which laid the theoretical foundations of the system**, and saw the emancipation of the socially oppressed in abolishing the religion itself. The protests, online and on-field, against the lifting of the ban on the APSC triggered debates over the theories and the legacies of Ambedkar and Periyar on sites ranging from the streets to television studios.

> The debates took place primarily between the followers of Ambedkar and Periyar on one side and Hindutva “theoreticians” on the other. **Interestingly, Hindutva theoreticians, who are out to appropriate a sanitised legacy of Ambedkar, found strange bedfellows in a section of Dalit intellectuals, who, of late, have been questioning Periyar’s credentials as a crusader for the socially oppressed, accusing him of having a bias in favour of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and against Dalits**.

> Hindutva theoreticians argue that Ambedkar and Periyar can not be considered equals and put on the same footing as far as social reform is concerned. And they have for company a section of Dalit leaders and writers. **They invoke the name of Dr Ambedkar freely but fail to realise that he had no issues with the social reform movement in Tamil Nadu extending the struggle to Dalits as well**.

> **Hindutva elements, which have been on a relentless mission to appropriate the legacy of Ambedkar, resurrected some clichéd arguments against Periyar, saying that he was a pro-OBC leader who worked against the interests of Dalits. The idea was to win over Dalits to their side by driving a wedge between them and the OBCs**. Unfortunately, some neo-Dalit intellectuals and fringe Tamil nationalist groups, which have been critical of Periyar and his reforms and view with suspicion any activism other than their own, seem to be playing into the hands of these elements.

> Periyar and Ambedkar undoubtedly had many commonalities on the social front, and a few differences which were not big enough to cast them as polar opposites as some Hindutva “ideologues” seek to do. **A discerning reader who sifts through their writings and speeches cannot miss the similarities between their approaches. Both campaigned stridently against Hinduism, which, according to them, sanctioned and ideologically justified the pernicious caste system**. Ambedkar, a Mahar from Indore, embraced Buddhism, exasperated over his community’s continued exclusion from the social structure; Periyar, an OBC, remained in the Hindu fold “to exercise my moral right to criticise it”, in his words... It is lost on me why the RSS-supporting-right-wingers, who are so eager to mis-read Periyar's political philosophy (as represented by his ideological think-tank DK, not necessarily upheld by political offshoots DMK or ADMK), stay awfully silent when it comes to **caste-views of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the founder of Hindutva ideology**.

**50 IIT alumni quit jobs to form political party** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: A group of 50 alumni from the prestigious Indian Institutes of
Technology (IITs) across the country have quit their jobs to form a political
party to fight for the rights of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other
Backward Classes.

The group, which is waiting for an approval from the

Election Commission

, has named their outfit ""

Bahujan Azad Party

"".

""We are a bunch of 50 people, all from different IITs, who have quit our full-
time jobs to work for the party. We have applied to the Election Commission
for an approval and are meanwhile doing ground work,"" Naveen Kumar, a 2015

IIT

Delhi graduate, who is leading the group, told PTI.

The party members, however, do not wish to jump the gun and aim for the 2019
Lok Sabha

elections

.

""We do not wish to do a hurried job and end up being reduced to just one of
those small political outfits with big ambitions. We will begin with
contesting the 2020 Bihar assembly elections and then aim for the next Lok
sabha polls,"" Kumar said.

**Read this story in Bengali**

The group, which includes members mostly from the SC, ST and OBC communities,
feels that the backward classes have not received their due in terms of
education and employment.

All set with a poster which has pictures of B R Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose
and A P J Abdul Kalam, among others, the party has already begun a social
media campaign.

""Once we have the registration, we will form small units of the party which
will start working on the ground for our target groups. We also do not wish to
pitch ourselves as a rival of any political party or ideology,"" Kumar added.

Sushma Swaraj will move to Mongolia after spending four days in China. (ANI

Union Minister for External Affairs Sushma Swaraj departed from New Delhi on
Saturday morning for her six-day visit to China and Mongolia to attend the
Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, which has been scheduled for
April 24. She will meet her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Sunday. She will
proceed to Mongolia after spending four days in China.

On Wednesday, China had said that its relations with India have seen “great
strides” and the upcoming Swaraj’s visit will further enhance “political
trust” between the two countries. “We believe Swaraj’s visit will further
enhance political trust between the two countries and elevate the China-India
strategic cooperation partnership,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua
Chunying had said.

Talks between Swaraj and Yi will take place in order to take forward attempts
by both countries to reset ties strained by last year’s 73-day Doklam military
standoff as well as a host of other issues. Both the leaders will exchange
views on bilateral ties, international and regional issues of mutual concern.
Swaraj is also scheduled to take part in the Foreign Ministers’ meeting of the
Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on April 24 besides meeting Chinese
Hindi scholars and students.

Swaraj and Wang will be meeting for the first time after his elevation last
month as the State Councillor, which makes him the top diplomat in the Chinese
hierarchy. Wang will hold the dual posts of the State Councillor and Foreign
Minister.

Meanwhile, Defence Minister Niramala Sitharaman is also scheduled to attend
the SCO summit on April 24.

These are the first SCO meetings after India and Pakistan were admitted into
the eight-member group in which China and Russia play an influential role. The
events will be attended by the respective Ministers from Pakistan. SCO
consists of China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan
and Kyrgyzstan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also due to attend this year’s
SCO summit to be held in the Chinese city of Qingdao in June.

**5 BJP ruled states have highest crime rates against Dalits, reveals NCRB data** 

 ______ 
Highlights 1 Madhya Pradesh recorded highest crime rate against Dalits.

2 UP recorded highest number of crime against Dalits.

3 Gujarat has seen rise in crime against Dalits during 2014-16.

The latest data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) may give the Opposition a shot in arm for the Gujarat Assembly election. The latest data for 2014-16 reveals that the BJP ruled states recorded highest crime rates against scheduled castes.

The NCRB data, released today says that the five states that recorded the highest crime rate in the category of ""crime/atrocities against scheduled castes"" during 2014-16 were all ruled by the BJP directly or in alliance with other parties.

Madhya Pradesh occupies the top position in crime against scheduled castes in terms of crime rate, which is defined by the incidence of crime recorded per one lakh population. Madhya Pradesh registered 3,294 incidents of crime against scheduled castes in 2014 followed by 3,546 in 2015 and 4,922 last year.

Madhya Pradesh reported 12.1 per cent of total number of crimes against scheduled castes registered in the country last year. Madhya Pradesh is followed by Rajasthan, which recorded 12.6 per cent of total number of crimes recorded against scheduled castes in the country in 2016.

OTHER BJP STATES

Rajasthan recorded 6,735 incidents of crime against scheduled castes in 2014, which declined to 5,911 in 2015 and 5,136 in 2016. Goa holds third position in terms of crime rate against scheduled castes. However, in terms of numbers, Goa recorded only 13 such cases each in 2014 and 2015 while the number of crime against scheduled castes declined to 11 last year.

With 5,701 incidents of crime reported against scheduled castes last year, Bihar stood fourth in the table. Bihar's share in the all India figure for crime against scheduled caste was 14 per cent for 2016. The

BJP is in alliance with the JD-U in Bihar, which had voted for the grand alliance (including RJD and Congress) in 2015. But, early this year, Nitish Kumar walked out of the grand alliance and stitched an alliance with the BJP to form government.

WILL NCRB DATA IMPACT GUJARAT ELECTION?

Election-bound Gujarat was at the fifth rank in terms of crime rate against scheduled castes. Gujarat has seen an increase in the number of incidents of crime against scheduled castes since 2014.

The NCRB data shows that Gujarat registered 1,094 incidents of crime against scheduled castes which increased to 1,322 in 2016. In 2015, Gujarat recorded a minor dip in the number when 1,010 incidents of crime against scheduled castes were registered in the state.

During this period, Gujarat has seen several agitations over rising crime against Dalits in the state. The crime against Dalits took political turn in 2015 when a family was attacked by cow vigilantes at Una.

The issue of crime against Dalits is one of the major poll issues for Gujarat Assembly election. Dalit leaders including Jignesh Mevani and the Congress have been raising the issue of crime against scheduled castes in the state for past couple of years.

According to the NCRB data, atrocities or crime against scheduled castes increased by 5.5 per cent in 2016 over 2015. A total of 40,801 cases of crime against scheduled castes were registered in the country in 2015 compared to 38,670 cases in 2015.

With 10,426 incidents, Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of cases of atrocities against scheduled castes accounting for 25.6 per cent followed by Bihar with 14 per cent and Rajasthan with 12.6 per cent in 2016.

In 2016, the rate of crime against scheduled castes of total cognisable crimes in Madhya Pradesh was 43.4 per cent followed by 42 per cent in Rajasthan, 36.7 per cent in Goa, 34.4 per cent in Bihar and 32.5 per cent in Gujarat. The all-India crime rate against scheduled castes was 20.6 per cent last year.

300,Scheduled,"When you read in the news, Upper caste men beat up Dalit or lower caste. Always remembers, upper caste here are not the brahmins, it's the upper caste SC/ST. 
2 major castes in KA are, Madar, Byadar (ST) and Naiks (Not Nayak, they are different) 

* A lower caste SC/ST will not be able to get his hair cut from a upper caste SC/ST. 
* Lower Caste SC/ST will not vote for a upper caste SC/ST and vice versa. They will vote for the lingayats (This is in Karnataka only)
* Lower Caste SC/ST is not allowed to drink in a glass cup in an upper caste owned hotel, they are given disposables. 
* ST's consider themselves superior to SC's. 

Also, not anyone can open a Laundry shop, you need to belong to the Agasar caste, anyone ele will be beaten up, do not expect police to come to help, they stay out of caste matters. Only expections are muslims, but they do not practice this trade. 
Similar for a barbers too.

Other advantage is you can play it while in office.

I have been replaying [Counterfeit Monkey by Emily Short](http://emshort.com/counterfeit_monkey/) last week. you have a device that can remove letter from the objects. So removing ""x"" from **codex**, gives you **code** to open the door. you can make **garage** from **garbage** and **car** from **chard**. 

The story is very interesting. It has multiple possible endings and there are lot of achievements to get. Its fun to see what objects you can make in this world. So replay-ability value is very high.

It will be most appreciated by Language nerds and computer nerds alike. Okay. So this may not be your typical comment, please be kind :)   
I'm looking to get back into gaming after a really really long time. The last games that I played were the first Assassin's Creed, the old NFS:Shift/Undercover/World titles and such (read games from '08).  
  
So first up, PC or console? I've only ever played on a PC (that I built). If i'm not mistaken (and please correct me here), many titles are console-specific. So, X-Box? PS4? Or PC?  
  
And some good titles to get started?  
**Edit:** And for online gaming, what typical internet speeds would be required? Playing Uncharted 2. I would never stop being amazed at whatever Naughty Dogs develop. Not a single moment of boredom in the game. 
Also playing Hitman (2016), the number ways you can kill your target is more than enough to warrant 30+ hours in the game. The very definition of a fun game.  Give a shot to **War Thunder**.  Much more realistic than world of tanks,  has air, ground and naval (in beta)  and feels much more satisfying. 

Cons: the grind is real in tier4 tanks. Russian developers,  who do stupid things at times. Cyka blyat.  [removed] **Attention Smartphone Gamers**, could you tell the game you're hooked on playing right now? Trying out this game called Aragami. Pretty cool stealth game. Basically, you're some sort of a shadow ninja. Haven't played much of it though. Other games in the pipeline include Metro 2033 and MGS: The Phantom Pain. Nothing but Overwatch for the past couple of months. PM me for battletag. 

Finished Inside and Child of Light on the side. Both way shorter than I would like them and not as difficult as you'd expect them to be. But both are fantastic with their own charm.

Played a bit of Super Meat Boy. It's definitely an intense and old-school-difficult game.

Really want to return to Smite, but just too lazy to learn the S4 meta considering I barely played S3. Stardew Valley. Started playing it in the first week of Jan and already 50+ hours into it. Still so much to do. 

Very relaxing and addictive :-) Awesome, reading all you guys' responses here! 

Just upgraded from an xbox 360 to a PS4. Borrowed a fifa16 from my friend, waiting on an f17 after my boards and looking at the PS4 exclusives to get later on. My brother would want Assassins, RDR, Unchartered 4, COD MW, will look at Forza for a racing game, maybe Mortal Kombat too. 

- which exclusive titles for the PS4 should I go for? 
- I should have over 35 titles for the xbox, 30 should be in great condition. My friends are recommending OLX to sell it off, what do you think?
- lol I'll make a PSN soon, any of you guys play f16?

Also, the Nintendo Switch will release on march 3, I was thinking of getting one since it's kinda inexpensive and gaming on the go! What did you guys think of it as a console/handheld hybrid? And the expected price range? I know it's got limited games rn but I hope Nintendo will extend that later on.  Just started a play through of Skyrim. And holy hell what a game. This is seriously the best game I've ever played. Almost every character interaction has a story. The environment is beautiful. And the RPG elements are bang on.  Waiting for Abzu and Subnautica Just finished a run of Mass effect 3 yesterday. Can't wait for ME : Andromeda. Also started playing Mirror's edge Catalyst. Gameplay is good, plot doesn't seem that coherent. If anybody here is on Xbone, please do yourself a favor and get EA Access, so many good games and the list keeps increasing, Just finished Ori and The Blind Forest on  Xbox One.. deciding on what to play next I bought all the story DLC for Batman: Arkham Knight and played through the new Season of Infamy missions, fun enough and true to the lore in many ways. The Harley Quinn and Catwoman DLCs, very interesting to play Harley, someone who will happily kill.

I never played Gears of War and I just got it on Xbox backwards compatibility, halfway through GoW2 now, this plus the next two games in the series should keep me occupied until Mass Effect: Andromeda comes out. Completed the final episode of Hitman 2016. It's a genuinely great game, but I cannot recommend it to people who have slow internet connections. **Mount and Blade** - Medieval sandbox rpg, sort of comparable to skyrim although completely different in terms of gameplay and on combining it with good and **huge** number of mods, it becomes a masterpiece.

**Vampires the Masquerade: Bloodlines** - also an rpg, timeless classic, if you can manage to ignore the graphics it can easily become your all time favourites. Be sure to use fanmade mods that fixes the buggy gameplay. [deleted] Highly recommended series of games by Rusty Lake on Android. 

Anyone have recommendations for creepy/horror games for smartphones?  Finished gta 5 main missions I've been playing some **Dota 2** and getting back into the **Guild Wars 2** routine. Guild Wars 2 is an amazing MMO, with great and constant developer interaction with the community, and lots of endgame content. Just infinite replay value, compared to most MMOs.
Haven't run into any Indian players on it though. Kind of a weird question, but I'm in Hyderabad and I'm told Shwetha computers at CTC is the place to go buy computer parts. 

Do they have EMI option for components? I just need a graphic card.  Started dabbling with Space Engine yesterday. It's so breathtakingly beautiful and mind boggling huge. For people who don't know Space Engine is a free universe simulator which is developed by a single person.  Playing MGS V and FEAR rn, also shameless plug of /r/IndianGaming    
 I've recently completed the campaign missions in Battlefield Bad company 2. Any similar recommendations?

Anything else I should be interested in this year? FIFA 17 on my new Xbox One since a month. Playing very regularly and getting pretty good at it, not that I hadn't played FIFA earlier. Ultimate Team this year is pretty fun and got a few new modes. Also Rocket League sometimes in between as a nice light game. Started playing few GBA games on my One Plus 3 using an emulator.

302,Scheduled,1. All adivasis are scheduled tribe but not all scheduled tribe people are adivasis. ,1522124210.0,0,2,0,70,,Modi Government Refused to Define 'Genocide' in Plea Before Information Panel - The Wire
303,Scheduled,"There are 2002 reasons not to define it. >Genocide as a crime is not given any legal recognition in the laws of our country including Indian Penal Code, 1860 , though there are provisions which make some acts which maybe otherwise taken to be in the nature of genocide as culpable offences. In this chapter we will deal with every aspect of Indian Penal Laws that help make such acts offences or provide exceptions or immunity to the government or any other aspect of any law with regards to offences which may constitute the essentials of genocide.

>Impunity Given to the Government

>In substantive terms, Indian law remains unable to conceptualize the mass crime within the inadequate framework of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which is better suited to deal with individual crimes. Taken a step further Indian law refuses to entertain the possibility of the state being accountable for offences it might commit. This is made explicit in Sec 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr P.C) which lays down that the sanction of the Government both Central and State is necessary before the prosecution of a public servant for acts committed in the discharge of his duty. Indian law entrenches impunity in law for its officials for offences it might commit against its citizens. The question of justice within the framework of Indian law will have to grapple with both the substantive and procedural provisions in the IPC and the Cr. P.C.

>The philosophy of the Indian Penal Code in providing immunity to those in control of the state of course makes sense when we understand that the IPC was drafted in 1860 and was an instrument of ensuring colonial control. In that context the classification offences includes among others the categories of offences against the body, offences against property and offences against the state. The significant omission in this classification remains the idea of offences by the state.

>Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989

>The only possible exception in terms of conceptualizing crimes against a collectivity is the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 which provides a brilliant ethnography of crimes against members of a specific community by actually fifteen different ways in which SC/ ST are deprived of their rights. The listing of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 is a fairly accurate description of the kinds of offences to which SC/ST communities are subject to in independent India. It concretes describes what the Rome Statute might have called persecution.

>The history of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 can be traced back to  Article 17 of the Constitution is that provision of our constitutional mandate through which untouchability was abolished and its practice in any form forbidden. Despite clear and specific constitutional provisions guaranteeing every individual’s right to a life of dignity, equality and non-discrimination, the shameful existence of caste-based discrimination and denials made this specific articulation on untouchability a necessity at the point of time when the Constitution was drafted. The Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 was enacted in order to enforce this constitutional provision.

>Communal Violence (Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation of Victims) Bill

>The one opportunity to take the question of mass crime seriously was the promise of the UPA government to ‘enact a model comprehensive law to deal with communal violence’.  This promise was made in the Common Minimum Programme (CMP). The reason for this provision finding a place in the CMP was clearly the horrific communal violence in Gujarat in 2002 under the former National Democratic Alliance (NDA). To implement this promise, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) has introduced the Communal Violence (Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation of Victims) Bill, 2005. Even prior to the introduction of the 2005 Bill, there were a series of bills circulated by both the state and civil society which sought to deal with aspects of mass crimes. 

>The Bill does not seriously consider any of the points made above and makes a mockery of any serious efforts to tackle state impunity for mass crimes. The critical analysis of the said Bill has been incorporated in the following segment.

>Communal Violence (Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation of Victims) Bill, 2009

>The government’s final version of the communal violence law empowers the Centre to take charge of an area where riots have broken out once it sends in central forces, if it finds the state government concerned reluctant to act against the rioters. The new law still does not allow the Centre to send armed forces on its own to a riot-hit spot.[25] But once a state has asked for central forces to quell violence, the Centre will have the right under certain circumstances of setting up a unified command, comprising these forces and the local police.

>The Communal Violence (Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation of Victims) Bill, however, says the Centre can declare an area “communally disturbed” and take direct charge only if the state concerned refuses to act against the violence being perpetrated to such an extent that the secular fabric of the country, or internal security, is endangered. To guard against political misuse, the law stipulates that the Centre must first draw the attention of the state government to the deteriorating state of affairs, and set a deadline for it to take necessary steps to suppress the violence. Until now, central forces deployed in a state worked under the control of the local district administration. But henceforth, in special circumstances, it will work under the unified command, which will report to the Centre

​

I am currently watching a video series called A History of India which was released by The Great Courses. In the second episode the Adivasi were mentioned and I was hoping for some more information. Sorry that I will just be listing the questions in numbered form, one after another, but it may be helpful if people respond with only one or more answer and can number them accordingly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. If a group is considered to be Adivasi are they also considered to be a Scheduled Tribe? Meaning, is Adivasi the exact same thing as Scheduled Tribe? Or are they completely different things and if so then what is the specific difference?

​

2. How does a group get officially recognized by the Indian government to be Adivasi?

3. Are there Adivasi groups in Karnataka? Where could I find a list of these specific groups? Is this anywhere online?

4. And lastly, does anyone know of any Adivasi groups located near Belgavi in Northern Karnataka? If so, where exactly do they live and what is their group name?

**Dalit groom not allowed to ride ‘ghodi’, assaulted in Gurdaspur** 

 ______ 
The Punjab police in Gurdaspur have registered a case against four persons for allegedly beating up the groom, belonging the scheduled caste (SC) and members of the marriage party in Khuthi village under the Dorangla police station on Thursday.

Gurdaspur SSP HS Bhullar said on Sunday that the accused, including Pritpal Singh, Amritpal Singh, Amarinder Singh and Amandeep Singh, all of Khuthi village, have been booked under sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 279 (rash driving for on a public way) and 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) of IPC.

Bhullar said that deputy superintendent of police (headquarters) Baldev Singh has been entrusted to conduct an inquiry into the matter. However, no arrest has been made so far.

The accused reportedly assaulted bridegroom Baljinder Singh, a Border Security Force (BSF) jawan and members of the marriage party over an issue as they were getting ready to leave for the bride’s place.

Meanwhile, the National Scheduled Castes Alliance president Paramjit Singh Kainth has intervened in the matter and spoke to the IG Border Range, Amritsar, Surinder Pal Singh Parmar, and got a case registered against the accused.

Kainth said on Saturday,”The incident is a prime example of the social boycott and social harassment that scheduled castes have to face, as the groom was not even allowed to ride a horse by upper caste assailants.”

He said, “The groom, his family members and even relatives were not spared. Women were attacked and many even lost their belongings. “ The SSP said that justice will be delivered to the victims of violence in this case.

Article on game we are working on.

If you are interested in updates about the game please like us on fb https://m.facebook.com/legendofabhimanyu/ Viva La France DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2 is coming out on Dec 5. http://store.steampowered.com/app/531130/

The game auto updated to v1.26 yesterday so I won't be able to play the Multiplayer for a week or two I recently discovered this site: gamexs dot in, good collection of secondhand Xbox One & PS4 games for a decent price. The Call of Duty games have always had fun single-player campaigns IMO but I've never wanted to pay full price just for the campaigns - so I managed to buy them all off this site and played through all of them.

MS released the Mass Effect trilogy playable on Xbox One and I had EA Access so got all of them for free. I was a penniless college student when they came out and I never played any of the DLC for 2 & 3, so I paid for all the story DLC and started with ME2, starting with a default background. This has turned out to be a mistake because Ashley and Wrex are dead. Wrex I can maybe live without but it was really hard to get over not having Ashley around (she is Shepard's bae in my playthroughs) plus Kaidan is generally an asshole. I played through ME2 anyway and somehow got Jack killed, which was another blow. Unfortunately, when I went to cure the genophage in ME3, I realised that because I chose to save Maelon's data Eve was alive, so I couldn't convince Mordin to pretend to cure the genophage. I had to make the hard choice, I had to do it. I couldn't let Urdnot Wreav start the Krogan Rebellions again. I had to kill Mordin Solus.

I had to stop playing after that. Now I'm going to have to go back to ME1, and keep Wrex alive and let that asshole Kaidan die, as a bonus I get to keep the rachni around as well. Sigh. Nobody here keen on playing Watch Dogs 2? Any 3DS users here? I've been hooked to the new Pokémon for a week now. Great new addition to the series I recently started playing Borderlands and Mirrors Edge again. In love with these games.

Also, does anyone play War Thunder ? Mass Effect Andromeda !!! Neverwinter Nights is available for free on Gog.com for anyone interested in RPGs like Baldur's gate. **Bloodborne complete edition**   Enjoying the shit out of it. 

Also started **undertale**  loving it so far. 

**Overwatch** is on back-burner.  Democracy 3. Solved crime problem in the country, had a surplus budget, made an internationally competitive economy. Suddenly environment pollution causes health crisis, worked doctors overtime, doctors strike. Lost election. Hopefully history would remember me well.  I've recently started with Prey. Holy shit, this game is crazy! **Critical Ops** on Android.

Counter Strike/Urban Terror inspired multiplayer FPS.

Really polished game and developers are quite active. Servers are always packed. I only play 10 minute deathmatch games and they are quite fun.

IAPs are just optional weapon skins and the game can be played without them.

On screen controls takes a bit getting used to. There is no controller support as of now.

As with all multiplayer FPS games, you will need low ping. My ping is around 80 on an average I can play without any lag.

Oh, and loadout is same for everyone. The game is cross platform (iOS, Android and PC). If you play on your smartphone, make sure not to play with PC players as they have better controls. I started Playing Rome Total war: Gold  Edition, I keep getting massacred by Gauls and Germans in the forests Rainbow six siege , multiplayer done right !!! **Titanfall 2**. Picked up, great campaign and multiplayer is oodles of fun. I just love how *fast* everything seems while not being taxing or requiring absurd APM.

To take a break from that, I'm playing **Planet Coaster**. Finishing up the scenarios and such. This is a worthy successor to RCT3, but I feel that it lacks a certain...depth to the management aspect in the Challenge mode. More custom scenarios where you start off in a bad situation are helpful. People have done incredible things with it, but it takes time to build something breathtaking. /r/GlobalOffensive, Hooked. How is Overwatch compared to cod infinite warfare and titanfall ? Immensely disappointed this time . Ummm. Zombie highway 2.  Civ 6

its awesome

The indian music is particular great, and evolves really nicely. Been giving halo reach some love... **The Witcher 2** and **Life is Strange**. I bought The Witcher 3 as well, but I'm waiting till I finish my Witcher 2 so I can port the save over. I bought Life is Strange Episode 1 months before it became free. Still need to buy the DLC, but out of funds. Bought a whole bunch of games in the Autumn sale. Still haven't finished the games from Summer sale. Currently playing Fallout 4, it's ok, the engine has some technical issues, but looks nice and some good QoL changes. Also playing Gears of War 4 in parallel, loads of fun. Total war series but Shogun 2 and FOTS are my favorites. Finally might win Dog in 2 at tough difficulty :D

Next in line is Wargame European Escalation.

 i'm going to install Ubuntu on my laptop and I wanted to know whether CSGO is supported on it?  I recommend you guys give **no man's sky** a try (or another try) after the new foundation update they game has become pretty awesome, 

also does anyone here play **blizzard** games like **WoW** or **overwatch** me and my friends are avid wow players we've been playing the game for about 3 years, 

we're on US sargeras and we raid with the guild currently lagging we raid every Saturday and Sunday evenings(Indian time) if you wanna join us or just want someone for overwatch and some random dungeons and stuff hit me up, we also try do at least a mythic +8 every week 

Bnet tag - Ghostdragon#129948 I am currently playing The Witcher and GTA. I know they are old but I love them.

Anyone here has tried the skyrim for xbox? I have the PS4, a friend of mine is coming down from the US in a week, I can get the Xbox One S for around 250. Is it worth it? Very confused on what to do... Are there good enough exclusives?  I usually pirate games, but I lost patience and finally bought **Hitman 2016**.

Totally worth every single rupee. Bought Crusader Kings 2 coz of reddit recommendations and the fact that it was on sale.

Slightly taken back by the learning curve... Has someone here played it before ? I just started playing **Dead Space**. Holy shit is the atmosphere and the music creepy. Thing is the enemies are not tough to deal with but hearing metal pipes clanging, chains rattling and sounds of things moving in vents above gives me anxiety. I sometimes take a 5 minute break to calm myself down. I haven't finished the game yet but so far it's one of the best games I've played.

Also, I play **Borderlands 2** from time to time since it's an overall awesome game. If anyone wants to co-op in BL2, PM me for my steam username. PSN is having a 12 days of christmas sale and they also have buy 1 get one free on their games. Personally, I'd like to sell my pre-ordered copy of Infinite warfare.

Coming back after finishing Uncharted 4, the controls feel a bit weird and still getting used to.

Really liked it, but still playing Paladins more. Anyone tried playing Arkham Knight? Was it even released?  Anyone can help me with some games for mac ? I have a MacBook prob 2015 15 inch. 

Also let me know if i install windows these games will run smoothly ? Playing **Assassin's Creed Series** and completing the entire series this year thanks to Jio.Will not be playing for next two weeks due to well... my boards.It's a great series BTW.

P.s. Anybody play AC 4 please put down your uplay to increase my ship speed in Kenway's Fleet.

I am also looking forward to RDR 2, Injustice 2 whether they come to PC or not.But they will (should) hopefully :) Sticky please  Got a new laptop with a low-range graphics card (GTX940M). It can play Far Cry 4 at low-mid settings comfortably.

Been out of gaming for a long, long time. Please suggest some games.

Nothing new AAA of course - won't run on my computer. 

Prefer games that don't have too much story and focus more on action. 

Any ideas? Finished Quantum Break on one sitting this Saturday. Very cool plot, they had 2 hours worth of live-action episodes in between the in-game 'acts'. Only gripe was poor performance.  Have been immersed in a few indie games of late. [Astroneer](http://store.steampowered.com/app/361420/) and [Empyrion] (http://store.steampowered.com/app/383120/) are two games that really stood out. Empyrion has really great crafting mechanics IMO (wish No Man's Sky had such attention to detail).

Also got around to playing Mafia 3 that had been sitting in my Steam library for quite a while now. Unfortunately, the gameplay is often a drag. Love the story and the voice acting though. Getting super hyped for the PC release of **Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3** that drops tomorrow! It's Mahvel baybee!  Horizon: Zero Dawn. It looks gorgeous and it's fun to play.  Playing solo Rust on EU 1 :( Currently playing **Dishonored 1**. Can someone recommend similar **single-player** games that have similar hardware requirements? Anyone in videsh now and returning in a few days/weeks ? I want to buy an original XBox 360 controller for PC. Flipkart shows out of stock. Amazon.com has high customs Why doesn't Nintendo lunch their consoles in India? Playing lots of Invisible Inc. It is so good at organically producing high-stakes heist movie moments! I am totally hooked. I just finished the beginner campaign last week, and now I'm making my way through the experienced one. The difficulty curve is really well done. I can easily see myself putting hundreds of hours into this game. I haven't even got the dlc yet! Project CARS, Civilisation 5, Left for Dead 2..

anything but Counter Strike... PM me.

**Modi govt to reintroduce bill to grant National Commission for Backward Classes constitutional status** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government will reintroduce a bill to grant constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes in the Lok Sabha in the forthcoming winter session, top government officials said today.

The move will make the NCBC a constitutional body with full powers to safeguard the rights and interests of OBCs, the officials said.

""The government is committed to ensuring equity and social justice to Other Backward Classes and has decided to take up the bill in the forthcoming session of Parliament,"" an official said on the condition of anonymity.

The proposed legislation is seen as a major push by the BJP to consolidate OBC votes in its favour.

Responding to a long felt demand from all categories of OBCs, the government had introduced the bill to grant constitutional status to the NCBC - on par with the National Commissions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes - in the last parliament session, officials said.

The proposed Constitutional amendment bill was first introduced and passed in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha then passed the bill but with certain amendments. This resulted in two different versions of the bill being passed by the two houses. Therefore, the bill will now have to be reintroduced in the Lok Sabha.

The NCBC, a statutory body created in 1993, was given limited powers -- only to recommend to the government inclusion or exclusion of a community in the central list of OBCs.

The power to hear complaints of OBCs and protect their interests continued to be with the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.

Since the National Commission for Scheduled Castes deals with grievances and safeguards of SCs as well as OBCs, it has limited capacity to address needs of OBCs, an official explained.

""This bill, when enacted into a law, will not only make the NCBC a constitutional body, but will also empower the NCBC to hear complaints of OBCs, protect their interests and safeguard their rights,"" he said.

**BJP-RSS meet takes stock of policies, discusses road ahead - Times of India** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The need to build strong narratives to counter “divisive” political
and social forces so that saffron mobilisation ahead of next year’s Lok Sabha
polls does not lose momentum figured in a discussion between

BJP

leaders and

RSS

functionaries here on Monday.

The meeting, described as scheduled and routine, saw a discussion on issues
relating to the need to unify society, as the Sangh Parivar sees it, against
caste-based challenges and issues such as criticism that the government had
failed to protect Dalits and harboured a monochromatic vision. With the debate
set to intensify as the next round of state polls nears, the meeting discussed
concerns aired by Sangh organisations whether the narratives the Parivar
believed in were being adequately promoted.

Senior RSS functionaries made several suggestions during the meeting of the
Sangh, its affiliates and BJP. RSS joint general secretary Krishna Gopal
chaired the meet in which BJP chief

Amit Shah

and five cabinet ministers were present to deliberate upon polices of the

Modi

government, including formulation of the much-awaited new education policy.

“Senior functionaries of RSS said there was a challenge in view of growing
debates like tolerance versus intolerance, nationalism and extremism, and
casteism which needed to be countered strongly,” a source said. He said there
was a concern about BJP’s adversaries consistently trying to paint a “false”
image of BJP-RSS.

Another round of deliberations is scheduled on Tuesday which will see economic
issues being discussed and this might include issues raised by Sangh outfits
like Swadeshi Jagran Manch and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh which have opposed
decisions such as privatisation of

Air India

.

The debate over employment may also figure. The meeting was held over several
rounds between ministers and representatives from RSS’s Sewa Samooh (social
work wing), Shiksha Samooh (education wing), Samajik Samooh and Vichar Samooh
(ideological issues wing). Apart from Shah, Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, Ram Madhav
and Ram Lal were present along with ministers Thaawarchand Gehlot,
Rajyavardhan Rathore, J P Nadda, Maneka Gandhi, Mahesh Sharma and Prakash
Javadekar.

Election for the 60-member Assembly is scheduled to be held in Meghalaya early next year, but the dates were not announced yet. The tenure of the current Assembly expires on March 6. “The BJP headquarters have directed us to prepare for the visit of the Prime Minister on December 16,” state BJP president Shibun Lyngdoh told PTI.

Modi would inaugurate a BJP office near the official residence of the chief minister and address a public meeting at the Polo Grounds later.

Earlier, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh was scheduled to inaugurate the party office on Thursday.

**Kumaraswamy admits ‘issues’ with Congress on berths** 

 ______ 
BENGALURU: Karnataka chief minister HD

Kumaraswamy

said on Saturday that there were some “issues” in portfolio-sharing between
allies JD(S) and

Congress

but the same would be resolved. He said this to mediapersons in Bengaluru
ahead of a meeting of Karnataka Congress functionaries with their party chief

Rahul Gandhi

in New Delhi. The late-evening meeting remained inconclusive. Another round of
talks is scheduled for Sunday, which the CM might attend.

Although he admitted there were issues, Kumaraswamy said they were “ not
something that will pull down the government”. A PTI report quoted the CM as
saying, “I will try not to take up an issue as a prestige issue and try to
solve a problem... Otherwise I will see. I will not stick to this post leaving
my self-esteem.” He was responding to questions on portfolio allocation and a

farm loan waiver. +

Congress sources said Sunday’s meeting should sort out some of these issues as
Kumaraswamy has had a telephonic talk with Rahul. The coalition partners are
expected to reach a consensus on some portfolios and form the cabinet with 16
ministers in the first phase. The allies are working on a tight timeline as

Rahul

is scheduled to leave for the US with his Sonia Gandhi on Sunday and return on
June 12.

During his 30-minute meeting with Congress functionaries K C Venugopal,
Mallikarjun Kharge, Siddaramaiah, G Parameshwara and D K Shivakumar on
Saturday, Rahul reportedly discussed the criteria for taking fresh faces. In
the 34-member cabinet,

Congress will get 22 berths and JD(S) 12 +

. Congress sources said the leaders insisted that the party should drive a
hard bargain for key posts as they had ceded the CM’s post to JD(S).

The latter has set its sights on finance, PWD, revenue and water resources,
all of which Congress also wants to keep. Kumaraswamy had met Siddaramaiah,
Parameshwara and Shivakumar on Friday evening soon after the trust vote to
discuss ministry formation. Alongside portfolio sharing, the coalition
partners will also have to reach an agreement on the 11 legislative council
seats for which elections will be held in the near future.

The CM’s office said Kumaraswamy was expected in New Delhi on Monday as the
appointment he had sought with

Modi

to congratulate him on completing four years in office had come through. The
meeting is scheduled at 11.30am, followed by another with Union minister

318,Photography,"[Shot a similar pic last month](https://i.imgur.com/Orxr7Q2.jpg) Photography is prohibited inside the Palace. Some high profile kids got into  serious trouble for doing a photoshoot inside. 

If you take pictures, dont post on social media sites. Woah it has some optical illusion going-on on the floor Please post this in r/incredibleindia post it at r/pics DMT palace you mean? ;p Imagine walking down this lane while being high. I went here as a kid, other than the photos as proof I barely remember it. Need to go there once again. We went on a Sunday in December 2018. My companion, who'd been there before, was surprised to see visitors freely photographing the Palace from inside and not being asked to refrain from doing so. So I suppose they've relaxed the rules. I went there on a class trip in 2007 and an artist was repainting the work on the columns. In my broken Hindi I asked if I could help him and he let me. But was unable to get a picture of me painting because of the photography restrictions. afaik clicking pics is prohibited inside that palace. The inside of my sore place looks way......shittier This beauty is unparalleled Hey OP, saw that glass window which looks like nothing is there? On the 1st floor? Where? Beautiful indeed thanks OP Mysore Palace is really beautiful. Great aperture with this phone's camera looking with the picture capability... Nic pic.

Pristine and well maintained legacy ! Nice Palace. i liked it. i love to explore this kind of places. +1 for taking care of the symmetry. Wow this is really beautiful.. love the symmetry Looks like there renovations are finally done. Have to plan a visit soon!

Delete this post Once upon a time there was great India Mysore 😍 All of you complaining about the processing this has gone through. It doesn’t matter as long as it looks good to the person who shot it. 
Bumping up the exposure and saturation on this gives it life and just look at it as a form of artistic expression. Peace. Great picture buddy 👌🏽 can’t believe it was taken on a mobile phone.

The thing with photography is you can become a pro by just being a hobbyist as well, a weekend or two outside and whipping out the camera to take pictures isn't a big deal. Maybe build a portfolio and apply to places first. But do this while you at least have a job. Photography is an expensive hobby.

324,Photography,"My colleague, a lookdev artist used to quote:   
""Camera is a mere tool, it's the eyes and brain behind it that matters"".   
    
That dude had a beautiful photo blog, with pictures shot on a 3 megapixel, point and shoot camera.  
    
    
Photography used to be a rich guy's hobby before the digital age. 
We used to shoot carefully to use one single roll for our college assignments.  
Every wasted frame was crime. It depends.

 I personally believe that a lot of beginners just get great equipment and the camera does everything, they're satisfied. They crank up the focal length and blue the background, and suddenly call it great photography.

Crystal clear photographs != good photography. 

A good photography depends highly on the composition of the image, a sort of mood that it evokes. I know that it sounds kinda pretentious, but that's what I believe it is. I used to do casual photography, nothing great, and to date my favourite photograph is one which I clicked on my phone.

That being said, entry DSLRs cost around 25-26k and they're more than enough to get you started with photography. Everyone is a photographer these days. So unless it's a hobby you are committed to, and you know your stuff, don't spend money. You get decent cams everywhere. Also every chutiya these days has a camera around his neck if you walk around. Learn composition and lighting. Then comes the resolution and sharpness.

Most people do not learn composition or lighting. I have a Canon 5D, Mark III, Nikon entry level DSLR, a Canon point and shoot digital camera and an iPhone XR. Guess which one I use for photography nowadays. My phone. I rarely take out the other equipment because my iPhone (or for that matter any smart phone) lets anyone to take great pictures by fine tuning the aperture, exposure and shutter speed and what not. And then you have a myriad apps to do post processing. 

So yeah, once upon a time photography was a rich person’s hobby but it is anyone hobby today and there are a gazillion places to learn, fine tune the pictures and showcase your photos... so no, photography is anything but a rich person’s hobby.
P.S. don’t get me wrong, costly equipment makes a lot of difference but remember, today’s smart phone can do ten times more than any camera did twenty years ago so the limiting factor is your mind.

I now regret not joining my school's tour to Kodaikanal.  Nice click Beautiful.....!!!!! I live in very urban City, so know how it feels when one visits such places..

&#x200B; The camera on this phone is stunning...  Kodai is great place - and part of the reason is that Ooty draws away all the crowd (especially honey-mooning North Indian couples). So I always feel a bit alarmed whenever I see posts about how great the place is.  Can you help me with a problem? I have note 9 and it takes shitties photos during night time.  I have to constantly clean the lens 3 4 times if I want to take any clear picture otherwise there is always blurry image captured. It was so cloudy when I went there that I couldn't see it properly.  :'( Isn't this some sort of 'Pillars' or something?  Smoke spot?

 Not a hobby per se, but you could try creating a code language or a new language. Mash up known languages to you, or just very well create your own damn language from scratch. You can use it with a select few close people or just your SO to communicate. Like to talk in front of children for example or to talk in public freely. It's really upto you really, how or when you choose to use it. If you do decide to do it, it can be one of those hobbies where it may even takes years to refine the language, depending on the commitment your're willing to put into it. If i may add, it'd be easier if you included the people you intend to use it with, to chip in when you're making the language. Besides helping in coming up with sounds or words, it will create memories which in turn will help in recalling and memorising, to use the language effectively verbally. ..Just a thought Aerial Drone Videography and Photography

Works perfect. Has a 8GB memory card and stores last 4 hours of video I guess. I leave my car in the hot Sun and the camera seems to work just fine. Has a very wide almost 170 degree viewing angle. The battery backup lasts just for 10 seconds allowing the camera to shut itself down properly when disconnected. I leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter socket. Got a splitter for the lighter socket so I have one more slot for charging my mobile when needed.

384,Photography,"> or does it depend on the employment clauses of the company I work in?

this. read the papers you signed when you joined your current company. It's standard practice among employers to include a clause that forbids you from moonlighting. So in all likelihood, your company should have that too. Ultimately, it depends on how cool they are with you doing a side business (provided they come to know). 

Almost everyone makes secondary income from equities, real estate, etc. and companies don't bother about that. But whatever you do, make sure you do not use any company resources (including office hours).  Do it in somebody else's name. 

Like an elderly relative or not working sibling.

 As long as your freelance stuff is not connected in any way to your full time job it should be fine. But do check your employment contract, company code of conduct and perhaps get written confirmation from your company's legal team. Just don't tell your employer or get caught. Talk to you manager/HR. As long as there isn't any **Conflict of Interest** situation, you should be allowed to do so. But it all depends on how anal your manager/company decides to be. The company I used to work for, before going full-time freelance, were pretty cool and had no restrictions on me doing a freelance side job, which I did over weekends, holidays or whenever I took leave. 
  
Do note that you will have to file your taxes for this extra income separately. So make sure to talk to a CA before doing so. > does it depend on the employment clauses of the company I work in?

Of course this.

In addition to checking that, there is a simpler logic you could apply. 

Don't focus on the end-product if it competes with your company, **focus on the tools**. If the tools are same, then you might land in trouble.

For e.g. Write Code for Day Job. Make Samosa as free lancer. Quite Safe

-----------------------

**A note on Websites for the absolute beginner**

Websites are basically just documents.

_The real way_

If you have a piece of text you want to turn into a website, you just have to do add some special formatting so that all computers around the world, made by different corporations and running on different software understand it in the same manner. This formatting is not very different from the way you apply formatting to Reddit comments. It is called HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language). So instead of using ** to make a piece of text **bold**, you'll have to write <b>bold</b>, and so on. Granted, writing HTML is boring business and requires great motivation (only) in the beginning. It soon becomes second nature.

I learnt HTML in this [easy tutorial in 3 parts](http://htmldog.com/guides/html/), only the first part is enough to get a working webpage.

_The easy way_

If you do not want to write HTML you can simply write up a page in MS Word and from the File Menu you will be able to save the page as an HTML file. When this file is uploaded to a fixed location (website address, such as one created using [Neocities](https://neocities.org)), people around the world can read it. (Neocities also has an HTML tutorial but I haven't tried it.)

Edit: Added a note on websites From past few weeks I have picked up a hobby of converting used Coffee jars into home decor items. They can be used as a pot for indoor plants or as a pen stand or a flower vase or a desk based decor.
This is my first foray into the world of crafts and my first comment on reddit (I have been a long time lurker). Apologies beforehand for any errors.

I hope one day I could earn enough to retire and pursue photography professionally.

391,Photography," as DSLR costs become less more people buys one and open a Photography Page on facebook and like to fill his TL for that gaze this problem seems to rise even more We were in a bus in Bandipur National Park, despite telling everyone not to use flash, this one idiot who was wearing sunglasses, takes out his phone and starts taking pic after pic with flash. The elephant got mad and charged towards the safari bus. We luckily escaped because the driver drove and then the tourist got the full ire of the official and the people. Fucking idiots.  This reminds me of the birds of Bharatpur.

We go on hikes at Karnala, Parsik hill and nearby green areas of Navi Mumbai regularly, however, we have stopped mentioning bird watching places anymore because soon a herd of photographers ""hijacks"" that place (esp Vashi for Flamingo) and leave trash in mangroves. Disgusting, I know but a ""casual"" DSLR can cost around 50,000 to 2L. It's ""affordable"" for many. Heck, even 18-19 year old kids are given DSLRs in my family.

Step 2: Post it on FB     
Step 3: Whatever anybody tells you or wherever your career is heading, keep on telling yourself that the guy in 3 Idiots was also after Wildlife Photography !! As an avid amateur photographer this irks me the most, when I encounter people who use flash, I try to handle the them by engaging them and saying that ""You won't get good photo with flash on"" most of the time they listen and turn their flash off.  I remember reading once that some cunt was crushing nests and eggs in them after taking photos so others wouldn't get chance to snap a pic. Motherfucker.

Anyway, shit like this is why ban seems like adequate response. civic sense is fucking uncommon.

I am currently studying in a foreign country and once per year I get a chance to see my family. Last time when I went back home I had two laptops with me. One of them was my personal laptop and the other one of my university(which I have to return back at the end of my degree). Some people had told me that they are not going to charge you tax if they are used laptops. But when I arrived at the airport they asked me to pay tax on the laptops. They asked me to pay 50 dollar import tax on the 2nd laptop. I told them that they were not new laptops but used ones. While I was talking to one of the officers another guy came from behind and started shouting at me. ""WHAT IS THIS ? OPEN YOUR SUITCASE. WHAT IS THAT ? WE KNOW YOU HAVE TWO MOBILES ALSO..."" . I realized later that they were only trying to pressure me into bribing them. Of course, I did not bribe them but I ended up paying 50 dollars on something I did not even own. Keep in mind that I am a student and 50 dollars is a lot of money for me. I come from a middle class family and my scholarship pays for my university.

> What types of jobs do professional photographers get into?

Weddings. If he enjoys it, there is a lot of money to be made in India. Prices for an experienced photographer range from 2-8 lakh per wedding (4 events) in Delhi and Mumbai. These aren't even for the top photographers. For someone with my experience, there is more money in Delhi, than London!

There is also even photography (corporate), and then there are regular portraits, headshots, model portfolios etc. These are like the bread and butter in the off season. Maternity and baby photography is taking off in India. Not as highly paid yet, but still around 15-20K for around a 3 hour shoot. This has a lot of potential.

There are other options like real estate and architectural photography. Lower end is not worth it, but if start getting corporate gigs, that's very well paid.

There are so many others, like product and food photography. Each is different and requires a different skill set/way of thinking. I think I am pretty bad with food. 

> Suggestion for a camera which he can kick start his career with. Budget = 30k

How long has he been photographing for? Cheapest DSLR, probably a Nikon D3XXX (whichever number is current), and a 35mm prime lens (can buy used for around 5K). You can even look at a second hand camera, as long as it is in a good condition. In my opinion, you don't get enough for your money by upgrading amongst the low end cameras, so you'd rather get the cheapest and use the spare money for other gear - this helps more than, say, buying a D5XXX. Depending on what he wants to photograph, he will need a flash (look for Yongnuo - and quite okay). 

Good luck!

>* On January 13, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) reinstated its October 2016 order banning all kinds of photography by flight crew on board an aircraft.

>* The move came five months after HT reported a first-of-its-kind complaint against six Indigo pilots who were caught taking selfies on board.

>* Taking photography during flight is a source of distraction, which may lead to error and resultant reduction in safety, reads the order republished on the DGCA website on Monday.

>* In a recent case one of the pilot was engaged in photography during training flight, which eventually resulted into an accident, added the note issued by joint director general Lalit Gupta.

409,Photography,"The photographer in question is well known in Indian circles as the founder of Emaho Magazine, and is on the board choosing nominees for an award in the field of photography. Given the testimonials he's fairly likely to use the opportunity for more sexual harassment. This unfortunately happens all too frequently in Indian workplaces as evidenced by the Tarun Tejpal affair.
After reading the testimonials do please share the link on facebook and cross post to other subs to spread the word. The victims have a right to have their accusations heard. Link to the original blog:

https://iwasharassedbymanikkatyalblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/10/i-worked-as-a-graphic-designer-for-emaho-in-2012/ More than 20 women have claimed on a blog that photo editor Manik Katyal harassed them verbally and physically.

---

> * Several young women photographers, in India and abroad, have created a stir in the international photography industry after speaking out against multiple incidents of alleged sexual harassment by a photo editor, who has now been sacked from his position as a co-director of a photo festival in Delhi.While the women have not yet registered police complaints, they have been using social media for the past few days to recount personal experiences of alleged harassment by Manik Katyal, the editor-in-chief of photography magazine Emaho, headquartered in Delhi.

> * Most of the online complainants have worked as junior photographers or interns at the publication, and some of their allegations of sexual harassment date back to 2012 and 2013.While most of the women claim to have experienced verbal harassment online or in person, some have also made allegations of physical abuse and coercion.On November 7, a group of photographers also created a blog titled ""I was harassed by Manik Katyal"", on which at least 20 women have posted personal testimonials in the form of write-ups, comments and screen shots of Facebook chats in which Katyal allegedly behaved in a lewd manner.In response to the flood of allegations on social media, Katyal has now been asked to step down from his role as one of the three directors of Just Another Photo Festival, a photography festival that took place in Delhi in September.

> * But the main trigger that pushed many women to speak out publicly was when Emaho set up a sexual harassment committee, said another male photographer who started the complaints blog along with a few colleagues.Emaho made the announcement on November 4 on its website, stating that it had pioneered the effort of being the first Indian online magazine to constitute an independent committee which is known as Prevention of Sexual harassment and discrimination Committee.Katyal started getting praise from some people in the international photography community for starting this committee, which made many women indignant, said the blog co-founder, who believes social media is a natural platform for young adults to vent their anger and rally around each other across international boundaries.

> * Meanwhile, women who claim to have faced harassment are now exploring the options of filing formal complaints either with the police or the National Commission for Women.The social media and blog campaign against Katyal has, however, already begun to garner responses from sections of the international photography industry.Even as Katyal was asked to step down from Just Another Photo Festival, a Dutch photography publishing house called Schilt Publishing announced that it had heard of some serious and disgusting allegations against a certain photo editor and that it would not ever tolerate the abuse and harassment of women photographers, or photographers of any gender, for that matter.The controversy has also sparked off serious discussions about sexual harassment in the industry and the lack of avenues for those who wish to report it.These are things that one usually gets to hear in whispers at first, said Sohrab Hura, one of only two Indians to be made a member of Magnum Photos, an acclaimed collective of international photographers.

NEW DELHI: Lending a testimony to Indians' romance with mobile internet

Niti Aayog

CEO (chief executive officer)

Amitabh Kant

, on Wednesday, tweeted that India has become ""world's no 1

mobile data

consuming country."" The tweet further said that,""It's(India) mobile data
consumption is higher than USA &amp; China's mobile data consumption put
together.""

> Amazing! With 150 cr gigabytes per month of mobile data consumption India is
now world's no 1 mobile data consuming... https://t.co/PnE4ihLdxo

>

> — Amitabh Kant (@amitabhk87) 1513908042000

Kant however, did not quote any source for the information.

In the recent past, India has witnessed a surge in mobile data consumption,
mainly with the introduction of

Reliance Jio

, which further led to competition in data plans among telecom companies.
Earlier this year, Reliance Industries chairman

Mukesh Ambani

had also claimed India's numero uno position in mobile data usage adding,"" Jio
users consumed more than 100 crore GB of data per month on the Jio network and
that's more than 3.3 crore GB a day.""

Earlier this week, a report released by investment firm Omidyar network
provided an insight to Indians' nature of mobile data use. The report claimed
that an average mobile internet user in India spends almost 70 per cent of the
time on apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, and music and entertainment apps.
This is much more than by people in the US, who visit these apps for only 50
per cent of the time they spend on the mobile phone. It further said that on
an average, a user in India spends 200 minutes a day on mobile apps, lower
than the US average of 300 minutes a day.

Winning elections doesn't give them a right to spew their ignorance on all and sundry matters. Lol. Chutya saala I doubt if he can even speak 1 word of Sanskrit  I wish I could conduct sanskrit exam all these fellas ! The single most important trait for science and technology is free flow of information. ""I see further because I stand on the shoulder of giants"".

Sanskrit will hugely disrupt this (there are hundreds of thousands of journals and preprint servers); the world is not beating down our doors to learn sanskrit to publish their theses.

Moving S&T to Sanskrit would therefore be a massively retrograde step for India.   Someone should ask this idiot: since Sanskrit is so useful to Science, Mr Singh, can you develop the necessary science to provide some scientific validation of this claim?

Yes, I know he was a physics lecturer. That makes this statement all the more unfortunate. 

Sanskrit / Panani's grammar were pioneering and inspired the likes of Chomsky to advance linguistics (later used for designing programming languages) - but it's not the most important component of science.   Sanskrit is a great language, but instead of making pointless statements like this, or attending meetings advocating cow protection, Rajnath could actually try and focus on his job. As someone who initially had great hopes on this government, I am confused as to where the priorities of this government currently lie. Says the guy who has credibility on this subject ..which is an Urban Legend/hoax. This guy is the Minister for Home Affairs.. Mutherfucker write a compiler in Sanskrit. I dare you. I double dare you. How the fuck did he get a Masters in Physics without understanding what science is? wut. As long as you can get your ideas across unambiguously, what does it matter what language you use? ITT, redditors who probably cannot even speak their mother tongue properly, decide to shit on ancient language - because they cannot use that language to lay bitches. 

 Advocating the promotion of Sanskrit, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said even foreign scholars have considered it to be one of the most scientific of languages.

Respect! Sanskrit is an exceptional language as it is an artificially created language (Sam + Krita which means Completely Done or Completely Made)....While Sanskrit is undoubtedly better than most of the existing languages in many linguistic aspects it might not be that suitable for S & T, a single word in Sanskrit can have multiple meanings depending on the context of the sentence, thus making it ambiguous & unsuitable for S & T... This ambiguous nature is also one of the reasons why many S&T things remained hidden in disguise of shlokas & mantras. No it isnt'!!! Because a more precise language like German is so much more popular and used worldwide in science and technology than a less precise one like english

424,Science/Technology,"why not start a gofundme campaign for the debt ?. Then may be his mother can manage for few months and meanwhile the student can pick up a part time job? I feel the best option here is:

- The student should move out of hostel and rent a house near his college.
- The mother should move in with her son here.
- Funds should be raised to support the expenses of both.
- As they are from an impoverished family, I am sure they know how to make do with whatever amount they have. 
- If the mother wants to work, I am sure the college too could be convinced to hire her as a temporary worker.

The mother just wants to feel secure and be with her son. This is the best way to go about it without disrupting his study. 

If you are not able to convince them, involve the educated community elders of the students family to speak with his family to let the boy pursue his education. As finance is the major concern, show them proof of how much their son can earn once he graduates. Find out their political preference, and involve the local leader (preferably elected official) of whatever party they like to talk with the family to further pressurise them. You need to find who has the most influence on the family and try to understand their concern and offer uitable solutions to convince them. 

And thank you for having such concerns for your student - our country is the better for it due to people like you.  ",1532362453.0,1,3,0,10,"I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:

A few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.

However, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the ""elders"", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the ""edlers"" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however ""allowed"" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.

Absolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.

As I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. 

The second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the ""family"" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. 

In IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?

Additonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(

Please keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.

Modi government has invited anyone with experience in  in law, science and technology, social service, management, journalism, mass-media or administration and governance.

DOPT  Circular - http://ccis.nic.in/WriteReadData/CircularPortal/D2/D02rti/4_7_2014_CIC-IR.pdf This is a good start. The current government has moved away from a seniority based appointment (earlier the senior most Information Commissioner was appointed the Chief) to an based appointment on application merit. Both processes have their own pros and cons.

However, there also seems be a road block. The [appointment process for a CIC](http://cic.gov.in/information_commissions.htm#19.) is done by a committee that includes the Prime Minister, one Union Cabinet Minister nominated by PM and the Leader of Opposition. We do not have a LoP as yet and any attempt to appoint one without the LoP may be viewed as a subversion of the process and therefore, unconstitutional. OR may be politically, we will soon see a LoP appointed. [**@OnlineRTI**](https://twitter.com/OnlineRTI):

While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

430,Science/Technology,,1558031892.0,1,0,0,1,"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",To Redditors of Kolkata
431,Science/Technology,"A country is not a country .....its a union of states.

A state is not a state....its a union of divisions.

A division is not a division.....its a union of districts.

A district is not a district.....its a union of mohallas.

A mohalla is not a mohalla.....its a union of families.

A family is not a family....its a union of individuals.

Whats the point ?? Pigs everywhere !!!! You sound pretty salty here. Let's clarify some things:

1. There are nations that form for different reasons. India formed because of the of a) The British (at least in terms of their empire) and b) The Indian Freedom Fighters (who tried to keep the country consolidated after independence. Kudos particularly to Vallabhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru. http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/S8YxVMKFfwaIeLHUWCYINI/Vallabhbhai-Patel-and-the-making-of-India.html)

1. Second, their rationale behind them was not to ""Collect Taxes"". Contrary to what you're saying, the fathers of our nation believed that we were better and stronger together. Patel, Nehru, Gandhi, Ambedkar, Naidu, et. al. believed keeping the Indian state intact was the natural thing to do. They had a relatively cosmopolitan education/upbringing and believed people of all states needed to band together. Their regional affiliations didn't necessarily bleed onto their mission.

1. While I agree there's a lot of graft and corruption in the Indian Bureaucracy and Political System, India has done well since independence, particularly in the last two decades. How can I say this? Well, GDP per capita has risen from $1100 in 1990 to $6570 in 2016. Here's the source: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?locations=IN

1. You mention India has a Billion people (1.324 Billion) and then complain about education for everyone. You do realize that's a LOT of people right. It'll take decades for primary education to reach them all. Some states are doing it better than others (Kerala for example). It just requires political will.

1. You talk about our GDP numbers like they're a smokescreen. It's not. India is one of the largest economies in the world and while our GDP per capita isn't equal to that of western nations and other Asian countries, it also means we have tremendous potential for growth. Something other countries are struggling with. I hate people comparing us with the US and other European countries. We're literally one of the youngest countries in the world! How well do you think the US was doing in 1860?

1. Democracy is supposed to mean every person has a single vote. It has its flaws, but it is the fairest form of governance. At the end of the day, an imperfect system is better than an oppressive one. And give Indians the credit they deserve. Modi was voted in to bring economic reform. People voted for him because they wanted better lives for their kids. Vote bank politics is dying, slowly but surely. 


Finally, I'd like to say, I know your intentions are very noble here. But it's easy to sit back and complain and bitch about the country. It's harder to roll up your sleeves and work for the nation. I'm not saying you don't do that, but r/india is a great resource to discuss this. There are many educated and diverse opinions here. Eventually, the unkills will leave the country behind for us. Let's not become like them and die saying Sare Jahan se accha Hindustan hamara and then having their kids move abroad.  Add a TLDR please..and I don't know what you are trying to get at.. and how you arrived on answer of union of states, from tax. 

Eating tax of a billion people.?? Which tax are we talking about? The number income tax payers is < 3 %

 >Nations are formed when a group of people identify themselves as belonging to a common genealogy and demand that they are the righteous owners of the land that they’re claiming as their nation.

This nationalism is a very modern concept. We been cosmopolitan from early ages itself. And cherished the subcontinent or peninsula more like a single entity of similar culture. 

For example Sankaracharya from extreme south established four temples at the four corners of modern India at an ancient time where nationalism wasn't upfront. Ujjain has remained the astronomical center for many of Indian calenders, irrespective of kingdoms. 

There is a reason for our extreme population, the land has been sought out by people from all over for fertile pastures and wealth, and those who came here settled. And diversity was inherent of land that shaped its culture, unlike other countries where ethnic groups clustered together. While in America every differences get melted into single stream, here people welcomed the diversity, and it still says that way. 

Also if European population hasn't moved out to their colonies, they would have been faced with this population problem as ours, am sure. > Tamils are more related to Sri Lankans

Nope. Sinhala people are Indo Aryan. They are more closer to Bengalis and Biharis than Tamilians. Your argument is trying to make India out to be a special snowflake.

Just look up the history of the **US of A** or **Germany.**

India's circumstances are not unique or new. These guys will give you the same old bullshit man that's the problem. Fuckers will still tell you about mother india being rich and wealthy centuries ago. We gave the world zero blah blah fucking blah. India is tragic as fuck, the talent and the potential is out of this world but the majority of the people are absolute fucking filth when it comes to mentality. Materialistic, show off, jealous, blinded by religion. Anything for the rupee, will literally sell their own mothers for money. They consider the ability to have maids and slaves as a fucking wow factor of living in India in 2017........all the butthurts are going to down vote this to death. 2 or 3 percent of people won't be like this. Biggest tragedy was the goras leaving. But OP is right though.....no unity at all. Which is one reason I love watching the Indian cricket team at least I feel like there is some unity, that and probably the defense forces. General public bheinchod tamasha dekhne ke liye paida hui hai. Bollywood, Ekta Kapoor, Politics, Babas.....so much chutiyappa. What you basically want is a federal structure, and you'd be surprised to know that the concepts of federalism is already there in the constitution. There are topics which are the state govt's prerogative and the central govt. can't interfere, and there are topics where the opposite is true. It's the reason why we have state governments at all in addition to having central governments. Federalism is something our founding fathers believed in, all it needs is to be strengthened and properly observed. I don't think your idea of completely splitting the country apart into smaller nations is viable. If nothing else, surely you believe that having a single unified military and financial structure is more beneficial than having dozens of them?

>A susceptible and complacent peon has the same weightage of vote as a well-learned professor who really cares for the country and contributes 10000% more towards its economy.

The point of democracy is that every citizen has an equal vote share by the virtue of being a citizen, not by the virtue of how productive they are or how educated. If you spend a few minutes pondering on what you wrote, you'd realize how unfair your proposed system would be and how quickly it'll lead to tyranny, by a group if not by an individual.

>When the quality of the population is extremely low because of the enormous population and lack of education, votes can be bought easily because they do not have to ability to reason for themselves, a day’s wage and meal is itself an accomplishment for most. Millions of people are swayed for vote by throwing one-time food and liquor, fake promises and fake news all because the pigs never let them get educated and forcibly put them in such a situation for their own gains to power.

Which is still better than not caring about votes at all and just shoving a gun at people's faces and telling them to do this and that. Again, while nobody says democracy is perfect, you'd realize it's still better than all the alternatives. Enlightened dictatorships only happen in fictions. This feels like a bad idea. Our ""confideracy"" of states will get chewed out by China. Besides.. being part of the same country is beneficial. Look at the water disputed between Karnataka and TN. Things would be a lot worse.  [deleted] ",1503787772.0,1,44,0,22,"Ever since I can remember, I have wanted to improve the state of affairs of this country fundamentally. As a millennial, when I was young I was inspired by our independence and the patriotism that followed it. But as I grew and explored what the nation of India intrinsically meant and what it’s true genealogy was, it started spiraling down to be an empty concept. 

Nations are formed when a group of people identify themselves as belonging to a common genealogy and demand that they are the righteous owners of the land that they’re claiming as their nation. This formation of a country, in cases other than autocracy, could be incited through a common ancestry, language, religion or ideology. The Indian independence incited us to form this nation, the constitution sealed it. But what is it really that binds us? Religion? No, we’re supposedly a secular nation. Language? Of course not. Ancestry? Not so much. Ancestrally, Tamils are more related to Sri Lankans than they’re to Biharis. Ideology? Nope. 

So why are we still a single country? Because, TAX. The centre can tax the whole country which is a HUMUNGOUS sum of money considering our ever-growing population. The governments have generation after generation fooled us using ‘nationalism’ while they eat our hard-earned tax. It is our money, it is our time and energy. I have agreed through the constitution to pay taxes along with my fellow people for a service, a service called the government. The only responsibility of this service is to improve the life of it’s people. But what it has become is a handful of pigs gobbling up the tax collected from a BILLION people. With this enormous sum of money comes enormous  power, the power to buy anything and everything. The power to buy the media. The power to cause so much toxic language pollution (fake news) that none of us realize what the real problems are. The power to stagnate education and hence reason. The pigs took away education from us, the worst thing that could be done as a government, it’s worse than physically crippling one. 

When we are given statistics like India's GDP is the sixth highest, it hides a lot of important information. Per capita is what matters. We're not supposed compare an economy of 1.3 Billion to 82 million of Germany or 127 million of Japan. There is absolutely nothing to be proud of. It's fallacious, it's a pseudo-statistic. The population of Bihar and UP combined is a 300 million. Yet we're constantly fooled by similar statistics that adds to our epidemic complacency that we're a growing nation. Science, technology, economy, healthcare, sports everywhere the statistics can fool us if we see us as just one country. 

Democracy is naive. A susceptible and complacent peon has the same weightage of vote as a well-learned professor who really cares for the country and contributes 10000% more towards its economy. When the quality of the population is extremely low because of the enormous population and lack of education, votes can be bought easily because they do not have to ability to reason for themselves, a day’s wage and meal is itself an accomplishment for most. Millions of people are swayed for vote by throwing one-time food and liquor, fake promises and fake news all because the pigs never let them get educated and forcibly put them in such a situation for their own gains to power. 

I’m no anti-national. National and anti-national don’t even mean anything if one digs deeper. They’re simply terms used by people for selfish reasons to stamp a person and reduce the details of what he/she says to merely ‘national’ or ‘anti-national’. We should simply stop using these terms and use a more productive terminology to label and discuss ideas. Everything is in the details, this is not about clickbait and headlines, these are supremely complex and deep problems that cannot be discussed and solved if we use crass terminology. The pigs are chauvinists and language polluters, they don’t care, they don’t even know, they will say anything to get media’s attention and media’s attention is more votes. What we need is a radical ideological revolution to give meaning to this beautiful ‘nation’. We should evolve to form a confederacy of countries based on a modern yet moral ideology.

432,Science/Technology,"Off topic, but I should probably avoid trying for FTII next year? I dont know about FTII. As far as research institutes go, there is a bit of laxity and there is no direction in research. Most scientists just want to publish papers, and I am not  trying to undermine the importance of publishing papers or basic research, but there has to be a goal of developing technology/product which aligns with national policy and interests. 

ISRO is a good example when a research institute is in alignment with national interests and policy. This example is probably a little simplistic because in institutes like IIT/IISc/NCL etc it is harder to define goals. And even harder to achieve these goals.

To develop a technology which is applicable in the real world, it takes a lot of time and effort and in addition almost every new technology takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop. From my experience the Indian research institutes lack severely in the latter.

There are several other problems as well, but be assured appointment of a member of board of director or even director of an institute will not affect the quality (existing) of research in the institute. And the low world rankings are mostly because of lack of infrastructure and lop-sided faculty/student ratio.

 [deleted] > Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?  

Because they have failed at their primary goals? Negligible research output, unimpressive pedagogy and a vision that is missing in action. A bit of a shakeup at the top wont hurt. 

FTII on the other hand deserved better than Sri Gajendra. 
 >WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated

Party before Country . Right-wingers definition of nationalism . kids have come to power after 60 years :) . Don't worry next elections they are gonna loose for sure and every state elections from now on  FTII, and Indian film making in general, is as shitty as it can get.

People say Gajendra Chouhan is not qualified to be FTII chief. I say FTII is so shitty, even a random 40 year old with some life experience can only improve it. The one condition is that he/she should not come from FTII, or Indian mainstream film-making, which is just pure horseshit. 
  how is FTII and institution of national importance?

Second question, why should government be in the business of running FTII. >But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance?

You have **one** data point for this.  OP, just one correction. BJP is not far right in the generally accepted spectrum. If anything they would be considered left of centre. Economically, not much separates the BJP and tbh most other parties. Between the Congress and BJP? It is just that the BJP has better execution of projects and lesser vote bank politics. Youth congress making a mountain out of a molehill. Just riling up students for no rhyme or reason. Did UPA not make appointments for these posts? Did EVERY government not make appointments? This is just a front. 

Students, dalits, farmers... UPA master plan ",1519157310.0,1,3,0,7,"Recently got my heart broken, realised it was unrequited love. Been feeling like shit since then. Now I think I'll have to live with this all my life. My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.

The anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. 

I was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. 

Nowadays for me a ""good day"" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called ""happiness"" it's just a myth in my opinion. 

I even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. 

Why is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, ""ohh what if I die single"" ""ohh why I'm a nice guy"" ""ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single"" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. 

Pre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is ""relationship goals"" why is my generation so much into this ""my soul mate"" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a ""shoulder to cry on"" ""another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day"" more interested in ""opposite gender"" if you don't have any ""opposite gender bestie"" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a ""significant other"" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth ""dating"". 

And what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start ""liking"" the other person then you ""propose"" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start ""seeing"" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being ""girlfriend/boyfriend"".

I'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? 

I've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.

1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.

2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.

3) I'll try ""pleasure-mastery"" therapy.

",1461563327.0,1,18,0,47,"Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

Anecdotal but i can attest to just a handful of my electrical engineering class of 61 actually understanding what we were being taught. The rest were just in in to clear the exams.

IMHO, another indicator of the quality of a country's education is the contents of the text books it's home-grown authors produce. The indians ones are by and large terrible. The focus on rote learning and mindless memorisation is soul-crushing. And those ""guides"" are so bad it's not even funny. 

This problem is compounded when the people teaching you use the same guides to teach and themselves don't understand what they're teaching. I got into several arguments about my scores being docked because i'd solved something by actually thinking instead of using what was in the ""book"".  Very well written!

IMO, the good faculties are on the look out for good PhD students and good PhD students are on the look out for good faculties. Currently, it is hard to find either in India. As OP mentions,

> The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation.

From the Computer Science and Engineering perspective, there are two sides to this. In general, a student who has the capacity to do a good PhD is likely capable of working in a good corporate company. Say a good student gets a job which pays ~7lpa. If he/she stays in the industry for 5 years, this would definitely (atleast) double. One can lead a good decently luxurious life with this sort of income. Now come to the Indian PhD student. He/she earns 3.36lpa + travel + book grants, for 5 years (it is not common to have raises for a PhD student). What follows is obvious.

Now one could argue that a student who is actually interested in research should not bother about money. But hell, the student also has a life outside research and needs to have some savings for the future! It is not easy to find jobs in India which require PhDs and do justice to them.

Now without good students, it becomes difficult for good faculties to 'want' to stay in the country. This can, again, be fixed by increasing compensation and freedom for the faculties. 

We need to take lessons from Israel. A country as big as Mizoram, has 9 universities, around 6 of them being in the top 100 universities of the world. Even though I do not trust world rankings too much, it is sufficient enough to believe that their 6th will be as good as our best. How did they manage this? I am not sure, but I do not think nationalism has played too much of a role. It is probably due setting up the best infrastructure, inviting the best researchers, giving them sufficient compensation and a lot of academic freedom.

**tl; dr** Invite the best researchers, give them sufficient compensation, academic freedom. Students and quality of research will follow. Can we also use the argument in OP's post to explain how so little engineering is actually done in india and how many of the ""engineering"" firms are just glorified contractors? http://408perceptions.blogspot.com/2016/08/engineering-in-inida-is-waste-of-time.html whatch this article

>As I understand it, the chance of getting an entry-level job that pays the required amount (16 lakh rupees/ $25,000/ £19,200) for a work visa is astronomically low, so I need to look at job areas exempt from this or other means of getting a visa. We could also get married and I could apply for an X-visa, and whilst marriage is on the cards, and eventually I will apply for an OCI card, the X-visa doesn't let you work, and so short-term isn't much use above letting me stay there whilst I look for work.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This can ONLY happen when the volunteer agencies who fill in the gaps left by the GOI
(1) are initiated, mandated and funded by the deep-state itself;
(2) inculcate through their activities a sense of mission, dignity and responsibility that serves aspiration rather than victimhood;
(3) are TRULY not-for-profit, and are not designed to perpetuate their own existence indefinitely.

This last is a crucial distinction; NGOs which define themselves as ""non-profit"" have a strong interest in maintaining the deprivation of those they claim to ""help"", because their OWN survival, and the perpetual continuation of their gravy train, depends on it. ",1403077051.0,1,1,0,1,"**Disclaimer**: I am not the author. This excellent essay was written by Rudradev@BRF.  

NGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).

There have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.

The problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of ""filling the gaps in services"" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.

The first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.

This American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... ""jasoosi kar raha hai kya?"" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: ""Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.""

And indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.

It wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.

The point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the ""greater good"", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.

One can almost understand the appetite for these sort of ""arrangements"" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.

The NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.

So now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?

The second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.

Mike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.

The solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.

Over 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.

What could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!

A very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as ""fascist"" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.

Can we begin to imagine a time when the ""marginalized"" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept ""marginalized"" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn't left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?",An Exposition and Solution to the NGO problem

This would be a journal of BJP stupidity in printed forget, See, people who are dumb, lazy, without an iota of critical thinking, comepletely superstitious, are very easy to subdue and control. You can guess what their endgame is. What's the end game?

Is this just another jumla to win more elections?

Don't they want to actually run the country for about 20-30 years?

Are they all one day going to get up and scoot to Antigua, Nigeria and UK?

Ambani cannot run away like Choksi or Modi did.

Nor can the Sangh.

Can't they see that the first chance that China sees of a broken country, they will try to control the country?

What's the 20 year game plan of Shah?

Winning elections is cool and I respect their awesome skills at manipulating everybody and everything without hacking EVMs, but in the end, where is this headed?

A feudal India is just waiting to be colonised or defeated economically to the point of virtual colonisation like China is doing with African and some Central and West Asian nations. USA is on the decline. China isn't going to stop till it becomes _the_ biggest superpower.

Modi can't see how he is dismantling the country because he is a psycopath who has achieved his life goal and is rudderless. He already has become King Emperor. There's nothing left to do.

But what's with the Sangh and Shah?

The Sangh plans well, like an expert Sith Lord waiting for decades.

I don't see an endgame here that benefits them - unless they really truly believe in a 1800s or 1700s culture as being the best for India. Then we are truly in the grip of a mad cult.

But I doubt that. Ambani, of all people, has serious vision. Will he step in and become PM? If not openly, by proxy?

Doesn't he have a vision for a billion and half potential slaves?

He has to understand economics really well, right?

Disposable incomes and all that.

What's the Sangh's endgame?

With Congress / UPA you could see that the endgame is simple - stay in power, do 20% good, 30% bad and 50% negligence - and just always stay in power. That 20% good was RTI and stable economy and all that.

With this Govt, there is literally no real 20% good.

There's only madness of one kind or another - cow, Mandir, vedic supremacy, ""China is bad"" while everything patriotic is owned by or made in China, Swachch Bharat is a joke, DeMo was a scam, GST is a disaster, Aadhar is a conspiracy.

Kuch to long term socha bhi hai ki nahi?

I can forgive Modi being a fool. He is a megalomaniac. But I cannot digest that all of them are fools and nobody is asking them to look at the bigger picture or the longer term.

They're behaving like day traders when they own the stock exchange. 

Who does that level of stupidity?

They are the house and they are gambling as if they need to win desperately. What gives?

Are they sure that they will not win more than once?

Is this all a 10 year con with their full knowledge that they cannot get a 3rd term?

If this is a 10 year con, which country are they going to flee to?

Local breeds are much more aggressive and a nightmare to treat.
And Buffalo milk is much better suited for making products like ice cream, butter, etc due to more fat percentage while buffaloes themselves are more disease resistant in general, and cleaner as they have almost no hair and love bathing in water.

 FIITJEE is the most fucked up institute. Their math books start with equations. Like wtf. They know how to make simple things tough. They produce top rankers only because of large enrollment numbers and a handful of south Delhi teachers. I remember last time they referred 'Ram Rajya'.

The tenure of this panel will be for three years. ""Though the panel — National Steering Committee NSC ) — was constituted long ago, it could not meet so far due to one or the other important engagements of its members,"" said V K Vijay of the Centre for Rural Development and Technology (CRDT), IITDelhi. He is one of the members of the 19-member panel.Amid indication of its first meeting some time next month, Vijay told TOIon Sunday that the panel will function as an apex body for guiding a national programme on 'Scientific Validation and Research on Panchgavya'.TOI had in February reported the government's plan to form such a committee. The panel includes chancellor of Nalanda University in Bihar Vijay P Bhatkar, IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao and secretaries of the departments of science & technology, biotechnology and renewable energy. Other members include Sunil Mansinghka of VHPlinked Go Vigyan Anusandhan Kendra which has long been involved in research on cow urine and cow dung.

Tuition around $120k total for two years. Living expenses depends on the city. But budget around $80k-$100k for living expenses for two years.

 ______ 
**India must shed intellectual colonialism to excel in science and technology** 

 ______ 
There is a major power imbalance in the world, which comes from the language
that dominates the world of discovery, innovation, and science and technology.
Today, that language is English. The intellectual domination of the West comes
from the building of communities whose power comes from their deep connection
with their native language. The language which they use to think, dream and
shape the world is their own. This results in ideas that can change the world.
If you do not use or have a mastery over your native language in science and
technology, then, mere facility makes you a great follower and never a leader.

While overthrowing political and economic colonialism, we have failed to
overthrow intellectual colonialism. In making English the sole language of
intellectual discourse in science and technology in India, we have lost on
many fronts. First, exceptions aide, as a community even our best institutions
can never lead globally if English is the only language of high-level
intellectual discourse. Our best minds will merely be eloquent paraphrasers of
the ideas of others. Second, we close opportunities in intellectual leadership
to huge sections of our population. In other words, as intellectuals we cannot
be the best in the world. In addition to this, we lock the doors to even the
second- level positions we occupy as elites. One of the many consequences of
this is a poor connection of professional leadership with our society. Thus,
we fail in being great intellectuals, we exclude and do not share a sense of
purpose for society. In turn, our society responds to this elitism by
undervaluing learning and the intellectual enterprise.

There have been many examples of countries which have successfully addressed
the twin-challenges of developing communities of intellectual leaders in
science and technology and are yet deeply rooted in using their native
language for churning ideas. In Germany, science students would have had their
principal language as German and yet be fluent in English. Many of the best
German labs are international and the language of discourse may well be in
English, yet, the advantage that comes from the ability that German scientists
have to think in their native language, in the most advanced scientific
subjects, is not small. Conversely, no country, including India, that has
chosen English as its primary language of scientific discourse, ignoring its
local languages, has become an intellectual powerhouse.

Whenever there is a discussion on this subject, two arguments are made against
university education in one’s native language. The first is that English is
necessary in today’s world, which is valid. The answer is not to diminish
English, but to enhance the use of one’s native language at every level. The
second argument is that the task is impossible to implement. This argument is
both a cop-out and false. It is a cop-out because not taking this up forever
makes us an intellectual vassal-state, while maintaining an elite that is both
dysfunctional and disinterested. The argument is false because the task is
entirely feasible with focus and investment.

What, then, is to be done? Currently, the bulk of our college education in
science and technology is notionally in English whereas the bulk of our high-
school education is in the local language. Science courses in college are thus
accessible largely to the urban population and even when this happens,
education is effectively, neither of quality in English nor communicated as
translations of quality in the classroom. Starting with the Kendriya
Vidyalayas and the Nayodya Vidyalayas as test-arenas, we can ensure the
training of teachers so that students in high-school are simultaneously taught
in both their native language and in English. This already happens informally,
but its needs formalisation. The student should be free to take exams in
either language or indeed use a free-flowing mix. This approach should be
steadily ramped up and used in all our best educational institutions in
college and then scaled to be used more widely. Public and private colleges,
in STEM subjects, for example, can lead and make bi-lingual professional
education, attractive and economically viable. Technology, can of course
assist implementation, but the primary driver is a will to change.

Our international partners envy the facility many Indians have with English.
Without losing this, we must also have the ability to think deeply about
complex and difficult subjects at the level of the best in the world. This can
come only when communities in Rajasthan, Kerala or Odisha can wield, in their
minds, their respective languages in the frontier areas of science the way in
which the French, the Dutch or the Germans do. We should not conflate the use
of English as the vehicle for communication and commerce with the use of
language as the basis for the power of ideas.

India will soon start producing first indigenous Lithium Ion batteries.
(Image: PIB)

India will soon start producing first indigenous Lithium Ion batteries. A
memorandum of understanding for transfer of technology for India’s first
Lithium Ion (Li-ion) Battery project was signed today between CSIR’s Central
Electro Chemical Research Institute (CECRI), Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu and RAASI
Solar Power Pvt Ltd.

According to the Ministry of Science and Technology, the indigenous technology
of Lithium-ion cells has been developed by a group of CSIR-CECRI headed by Dr
Gopu Kumar in partnership with CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL)
New Delhi, CSIR- Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute (CSIR-CGCRI)
Kolkata and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) Hyderabad.

“CSIR-CECRI has set up a demo facility in Chennai to manufacture prototype
Lithium-Ion cells. It has secured global IPRs with potential to enable cost
reduction, coupled with appropriate supply chain and manufacturing technology
for mass production,” a Science and Technology Ministry release said today.

At present India depends on countries like China, Japan and South Korea for
import of Lithium Ion batteries. India imported Li-Ion batteries worth $150
million in 2017 and is one of its largest importers in the world.

Speaking after the signing of MoUs, Union Science and technology minister
Harsh Vardhan said: “Today’s development is a validation of the capabilities
of CSIR and its laboratories to meet technology in critical areas to support
our industry, besides other sectors.”

**ALSO READ| Chinese smartphone maker to locally source this crucial component**

The indigenous production of Li-Ion batteries is expected to boost Prime
Minister Modi flagship programmes like generating 175 Giga Watts of clean
energy by 2022 and National Electric Mobility Mission.

“It will give tremendous boost to two flagship programmes of Prime Minister
Narendra Modi – increasing the share of Clean Energy in the energy basket by
generating 175 Giga Watts by 2022, of which 100 Giga Watts will be Solar and
the second, National Electric Mobility Mission, to switch completely to
electric vehicles by 2030,” said Harsh Vardhan.

The project, the minister said, is also in tune with PM Modi’s vision of “Make
in India” to turn the country into ” a manufacturing hub and to cut down
outflow of foreign exchange.”

As per the MoU, Raasi Group will set up Li-Ion manufacturing facility in Tamil
Nadu’s Krishnagiri district, which is close to Bengaluru. The company aims to
bring down the cost of cell manufacturing below Rs 15,000 per KW to replace
the Lead Acid batter. The company also plans to manufacture Li-Ion battery for
solar rooftop with life span of 25 years.

“We want to bring down the cost of cell manufacturing below Rs. 15,000/- per
KW to replace Lead Acid Battery…“We also have plans to make Lithium Ion
battery for solar roof top with life span of 25 years to make it affordable
enough to drive the Photo Voltaic segment,” Raasi Group Chairman-cum-Managing
Director C Narsimhan said.

Why Lithium-Ion batteries:

Li-Ion batteries have applications in Energy Storage System – from hearing aid
to container sized batteries to power a cluster of villages, Electric Vehicles
(2-wheeler, 3-wheeler, 4-wheeler and Bus), portable electronic sector, Grid
Storage, Telecom and Telecommunication Towers, Medical Devices, Household and
Office Power Back (UPS), Powering Robots in Processing Industry.

Lithium-ion batteries can power any electrical application without the need of
physical wires-means wireless.

Often times it is about projecting their shortcomings on their children - 'Hey I wasn't able to crack this engineering\medicine course, I hope my child does it' So even without understanding what their child wants they go about forcing them to become who they were unable to be!

Although I agree that math and science is not the sole criteria for measuring a kid, I do believe we need it in our lives to understand things around us - what we can do is make it interesting in the lower standards, like a game, so that students don't feel it as a chore. My parents used this method and I found myself engaged in math & science from a very young age.

Even though US follows the Prussian model, they give a whole variety of other things for the child to choose from to help him/her identify their core competency. This is lacking in India though - athough there's a marked change recently albeit only for those who can afford it.

What the post is suggesting is somewhat similar to Rabindranath Tagore's Shantiniketan Academy isn't it? I once an interview with Amartya Sen about how the eclectic environment of Shantiniketan shaped his mind, I've always been interested in the model of 'open', 'interest based' learning. Yes, some things are necessary and have to be compulsory - such as arithmetic and language, even if children are not interested in them.

But all other disciplines should be learned in a sort of mixed way. For example, why separate History and Literature? Why not study the great texts of the past to study about past society and learn the intricacies of great literature? I've always thought this would be an interesting approach. One could do the same for geography, learn stories from different places, then discuss the environment in which they take place.

Science should be more story based too, linked into history and literature, about how human discovered more and more about the world, leading to scientific revolution and the world of today.

All this can only happen when school occurs in a more relaxed atmosphere. I like the idea of not having rows, perhaps we should have more garden based learning, something like the Ashramas of old, with lessons and sport intermixing, with perhaps theatre and dance, singing, etc.

All this sounds too utopian, but maybe schools can start by designating one month for such kind of learning and see the results. Education needs reform though, even the most radical ideas should not be rejected out of hand.

RSS made a deal with modi, if BJP comes to power they will dictate cultural agenda of the Government. Then they put their stooges in ministries that influence the following:

> school curricula, art and cinema, science and technology and libraries

That's why Smriti Irani is HRD minister instead of Yashwant Sinha or some qualified politician.

These stooges report direct to RSS and have regular meetings with people from RSS to give them progress cards and take directions from them.

Systematically all organisations have been taken over :

1. IITs (Baba Ramdev incident in IIT Delhi)
2. CBSE(Dinanath batra)

To further their ""patriotism and hinduism"" agenda it means they need money and this is coming from budget cuts for research endeavours.

If somebody doesn't respect the international peer reviewed version of science & technology by calling it ""westernized"" then India will definitely fall behind others when budget cuts are made and research output is thought of as bogus ""westernized"" research. This can be seen by the fact that for the history research grants commission a person without one peer reviewed paper was made head.

Even highly patriotic countries with language barriers like Japan, South Korea and China believe in the international science system.

Also, haters please note - there is a big difference between Lingua Franca and Majority Language. Two completely different concepts. Lingua franca is what you use when you converse with someone who doesn't understand your mother tongue (like many Indians use English today to speak to each other, Europeans used French earlier, etc.), majority language is just the language that becomes widespread and is spoken by a lot of people.

**View: A compelling case to have Bengaluru as second Indian capital** 

 ______ 
** By Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw **** **

The recent suggestion by

RV Deshpande

, Karnataka's minister for large &amp; medium industries and infrastructure
development, that

Bengaluru

be given the status of a second capital of

India

has sparked off an interesting debate.

For a country as vast and ethnically diverse as India, I believe there is a
compelling case to create a southern capital for all the reasons that
Deshpande has outlined in his letter to the prime minister.

The concept of two capital cities is not uncommon: nearly 15 countries across
the world have multiple capitals. For instance, Bolivia, Georgia and the
Netherlands have two capitals! South Africa has three capitals — Bloemfontein,
Cape Town, and Pretoria — that house its judicial, legislative and executive
branches.

Bengaluru's strongest claim to being India's second capital lies in its status
as the country's science and technology (S&amp;T) hub. It's only our
scientific prowess that can help propel India into a higher growth orbit.

Bengaluru boasts a mature S&amp;T ecosystem, which has attracted several MNCs
to invest in the city to conduct their R&amp;D operations. The government,
industry and academia here have provided the impetus for the development of
the S&amp;T sector in terms of the availability of a scientific workforce,
world-class R&amp;D infrastructure and investor-friendly policies.

The information technology and biotechnology booms have engendered a strong
entrepreneurial culture in the city. Bengaluru is already the ""Science
Capital"", ""Startup Capital"", ""IT Capital"" and ""Biotechnology Capital"" of the
country.

By proposing it as a second capital, the intent is not to duplicate the
administrative infrastructure with overlapping jurisdictions, but rather to
have a more efficient and optimal distribution of ministries between New Delhi
and Bengaluru. It means leveraging the core competence of Bengaluru as India's
Knowledge Capital.

The city possesses the kind of intellectual capital that can drive the
evolution of forward-looking, next-generation policies that will enable India
to leapfrog to global leadership in S&amp;T. There is a strong case for
implementing over the next five years a plan to relocate the science-related
ministries from New Delhi to Bengaluru. These ministries will benefit
immensely from the scientific culture of the city. It will also help the
government in keeping its ear to the ground when formulating policies.

The success of India's space programmes is due in large measure to the
Department of Space being based in Bengaluru. Housing the ministries of
science &amp; technology and electronics &amp; information technology in
Bengaluru would throw open many new avenues for closer collaboration that can
lead to greater success of these sectors. For instance, agencies like Unique
Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), if located in Bengaluru, can
benefit immensely from the large IT ecosystem and the rising status of the
city as the data science hub of the country.

As India's Science Capital, Bengaluru can be the epicentre for pushing India
towards a more digital and formalised economy, while enabling e-governance and
participatory policy-making through the government's

Digital India

initiative. Currently, the southern states feel alienated when it comes to a
redress of issues and policymaking.

As a second centre of administrative power, Bengaluru can help ease the burden
of governance through greater expediency and efficiency.

By giving Bengaluru the status of India's second capital, not only will the
Indian government help unleash the huge potential of the country's innovative
S&amp;T prowess, it will also send out a strong signal that the South is a
very integral part of the country.

470,Science/Technology,"Regardless of the good news, it is hard to trust a list that gives a higher research score to NUS than MIT.  [deleted] ""Lund"" is ahead of IISc. :D Fuck yeah

PS - Always take these rankings with a pinch of salt. They are very much anglo-saxon oriented and each of them use different metrics. 
For e.g. - If you consider Munich or Berlin or Zürich, they in the Germanic tradition separate universities of basic learning and universities of technology, which the UK and US mostly don't. All of their big unis do research in and teach all disciplines. But say for .e.g in IISc or at the University of Munich, you don't do technology. That's the domain of the technical universities (Technische Hochschulen or Technische Universitäten). If you club them together, then Munich and Berlin would rank in the top 25 based on pure research output and impact. But most of these rankings also consider things like the ratio of international students and gender equality and social impact etc. 

If you want to do a good intensive Master's programme and then a PhD, choose a smaller university. The instructors are more hands-on. I studied at the Uni of Munich and except 2 professors, all the other big guys sent in their post-docs to teach. A friend of mine did her MSc in Neuroscience at the Uni of Edinburgh, and it was just 1 year and just 3 months of thesis. They hardly learnt anything general; it was way too focussed on a few particular topics. And in the same way, choose a doctoral advisor (PI) who is an up and coming star instead of a well-established professor, because the younger guy will be more hands-on because he is in line for big grants and a future Chair at a big Uni.  There was another ranking a few weeks back where the IITs were ranked at 600 right? So is this another ranking? Thanks in advance for clarifying.  IISc: 19 : 81 Female:Male Ratio [deleted] And this institute had to bend over because of ego of the current government. It's a shame that such nice institutes cannot freely decide how they want to teach. The Indian Institute of Science Bangalore is the first Indian university to enter the list.

478,Science/Technology,"Awesome! I read about this sometime back, but it was speculation and not the conclusion of a study then.

Anyone interested in reading viewpoints such as of these researchers should read The Indian Clerk, a book about Ramanujan and his time in England. People are arguing that the Taylor series was proof of invention of calculus. Bitch pls. Be proud if you want to but get your facts right.

While I understand that the Taylor series is a very important concept in calculus, it isn't necessary to combine the ideas of infinitesimal sums and differences, convergence, divergence and limits to get to it. The form newton and leibnitz fought over inventing was one which had these concepts (as evidenced by newton promptly using it for his kinematics work).

So no, in the true sense, I wouldn't call this the invention of calculus. But it's an absolutely important step there nonetheless... something which neither newton nor leibnitz had set eyes on, so careful before you start accusing them of plagiarizing.  These are REAL Indian achievements. I have no idea why the wingnuts insist on tom-tomming the Taj as a Shiv mandir when there actually are real things to be proud of.  Really, this is new? I thought Madhava and the taylor series has been known for a quite a while now. Newton wasn't even the 1st European to develop the calculus.  A better title would be ""Medieval scientists in Kerala invented Infinite Series centuries before the West"".

This is indeed admirable, but please do remember that calculus isn't just about infinite series, the concept of limits, infinitesimal small changes and their infinite sums is crucial. Infinite series is just one part of the stepping stones to calculus.

Regardless, this is definitely something to be proud about. It's interesting to see proper research into the Indian history of the maths, sciences and economics; since this is severely lacking in our narratives of history. However, using clickbaity headlines is a bit disingenuous, but to be expected. It is a 2007 article, going by the date.

>""There were many reasons why the contribution of the Kerala school has not been acknowledged,"" he said. ""A prime reason is neglect of scientific ideas emanating from the Non-European world, a legacy of European colonialism and beyond.""

>However, he concedes there are other factors also in play.

>""There is also little knowledge of the medieval form of the local language of Kerala, Malayalam, in which some of most seminal texts, such as the Yuktibhasa, from much of the documentation of this remarkable mathematics is written,"" he admits.

I think Mr Gevarghese George, who sounds like an Indian, has got his primes mixed up. The Brits were rather interested in what we had discovered and what we believed, if the Journal of the Asiatic Society is anything to go by. I would say that the prime reason is what he accepts as 'other factors', something for which the blame lies squarely at our own feet.

I think we have done much more than just this - in Advanced Mathematics and Astronomy. And then let it all go to seed ... This is mentioned in Wikipedia. 

>In the 14th century, Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama and the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics stated components of calculus such as the Taylor series and infinite series approximations. However, they were not able to combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between the two, and turn calculus into the powerful problem-solving tool we have today

The researcher of this article is George Gheverghese Joseph from Kerala. 

 V INVANTED CALCULUSS [removed] Shocked that I haven't seen a **so prod v invant** comment here so far. 

Anyway, now that Western scientists have put this matter to rest, I am sure our fellow randians are convinced. Otherwise we would have seen a bunch of disparaging comments about the people who say anything along these lines. Secular feathers will be ruffled. Kya ukhaad liya calculus invent karke Everytime someone comes out with statements like this (especially if they are right), the natural question that arises is - then what the f*** are we doing with our garbage heap of an education system, rote learning, utter absence of creativity, and spectacles like a daytime drama queen (literally) as the person in charge of education, chokehold of bureaucracy, anaemic support for higher education, and research (0.7% vs. 3% of GDP that all of our competitors have)? It must have been invented we had a very skilled and glorious past. Even scientists today r baffled by indian architecture which was created in past. The ashoka pillar is the iron pillar standing in open since years without any rust, and taj mahal ajanta ellora paintings etcetc. But sad truth is today we are a third world country with poverty population explosion and corruption. Just coz ur father was a rich n successfull businessman doesnt mean u keep on doing nothing and encash on his name hope this is clear Not sure, why we always want to compare our civilization with western one. Seems like we still have the inferiority complex because western one ruled over us. 

We know  India is one of the oldest and great civilization. A lot of was discovered and invented in India. But can we focus on how what we are today. Even if Calculus was created in India, no one can deny that Leibniz, Newton and western civilization reinvented it, documented it, promoted it, applied it and made it part of math curriculum. 

So even if India  created calculus, stop finding reasons for how great we were, and discuss on how can be great today.
 Calculus is INDIAN^Mlecch_Certified where is the anti kulcha people now Doesn't matter, because Issac Newton was Indian too. He was kidnapped from Yamuna vaidhshalaya (university) and brainwashed by white people. His real name was Isayu Nathuram. Look it up on Subramanian Swamy's facebook page if you don't beleive me. So we inveneted calculus either way. so prod of r kulcha Doesn't matter. Issac Newton (Ishant Nutan) was actually of Indian origin. His father had emigrated from India.  That is why his father forced Ishant to learn Sanskrit which was responsible for Ishant creating Calculus. ITT : not history not a lot of math, does not compute at all.

Prime minister Narendra Modi’s pledge to place India among the top three countries in the world in the field of science and technology (S&T) by 2030—announced at the Indian Science Congress in Tirupati earlier this month and reiterated at the Nobel prize exhibition in Ahmedabad this week—is a fine sentiment. But it is also a grandiose one. Getting even part-way there is going to take some doing. India performs below its potential on just about every indicator of scientific progress and achievement there is: be it the amount of public and private funding earmarked for research, the number of prestigious awards won by Indian scientists working in Indian institutions, the number of patents registered in the names of Indians or the number of articles published in well-known peer-reviewed journals.

India has a long civilizational history of scientific achievement. But today the list of Indian scientists who have won the world’s most prestigious award, the Nobel, begins and ends with C.V. Raman. The longer list of Indian-origin and Indian-born winners has 16 mentions—but that also only highlights the large-scale systemic failures that extend across institutions and manifest at all levels.

Only time will tell if the Modi government will be able to put in motion the revamp he has spoken of. But for now, there are early indicators that give us some idea of the government’s plans and priorities.

First is the government’s focus on improving science education at the school level: In Ahmedabad, Modi spoke of scientists helping develop course modules while in Tirupati, he mentioned scientific social responsibility wherein premier laboratories and research institutions could partner with nearby schools and colleges to create an environment that supports scientific education and innovation. This is well and good. But these are in the nature of vague, broad ideas, when what is needed is foundational work on the overall education system.

A human resource and development ministry report tabled in Parliament last month noted that as many as a million teaching positions in government schools across the country are lying vacant; successive status of education reports by the non-profit Pratham have highlighted how educational outcomes among Indian school students are falling at an alarming rate.

The situation in institutions of higher education is hardly any better. Elite institutions such as the IITs are the exception, and they too struggle to compete globally. In the QS World University Rankings 2016-17, only two Indian institutions ranked among the top 200 universities in the world: Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (rank 152) and Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (rank 185). Research institutions also suffer from government interference and lack of funding which, among other problems, makes them unattractive to rising talent that prefers greener pastures abroad.

The second issue that the government is focusing on is strengthening the links between S&T and industry. If done right, this could potentially bring in the resources necessary to boost Indian science. Currently, much of the funding comes from the government while private-sector investment (in the form of research and development centres, for example) is below par. Overall, despite talk since the late 1980s of increasing S&T investments from the public and private sector to 2% of GDP (gross domestic product), the figure still hovers at around 0.9%. In comparison, South Korea leads the race, investing 3% of its GDP in S&T, while Japan follows close behind.

Another example is tiny Israel, which has not only nurtured a flourishing S&T ecosystem but leveraged its security challenges to build a robust defence industry. In India, it will be interesting to see if the Modi government’s flagship scheme to boost domestic manufacturing and its consequent efforts to woo foreign capital (specifically in defence) can do something similar.

Against this backdrop, it was perhaps in the fitness of things that the Nobel exhibition, which brought nine Nobel laureates on one platform in Ahmedabad, was organized in association with an investment summit to underline how science, technology and innovation hold the key to enterprise and entrepreneurship. The event is part of the larger Nobel Prize Series—and can be seen as part of the government’s larger effort to make science more glamorous. But talk is cheap. If there is to be real progress, it will need unglamorous, ground-level work. Fetishizing the Nobel as an end in itself—as Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu did last week when he announced Rs100 crore in prize money for anyone from his state who wins the prize—will not be enough.

Uhh what? I think history has shown that, people who stick to their ""traditions"" instead of adapting to a changing world, are the ones who die out.

  By Amit Kapoor  

 

  A special ""Nobel Series"" session was a notable addition at the latest Vibrant Gujarat Summit (January 9-12).  

 

  Nine laureates were invited to share their thoughts about the challenges of humankind and what could be done to alleviate them. A Nobel exhibition is housed in Ahmedabad's Science City for five weeks post the summit. The scientists discussed the importance of science and technology for India to become a knowledge superpower. They also interacted with students and shared their research and general approach to science and technology.  

 

  While all this bodes well for the rise of Indian states in the global arena, what is important is that, of late, Indian states are recognising the need for not only inviting creative individuals but also trying to enable an ecosystem that helps people grow and make the best of every opportunity.  

 

  A question is: Why foster science and technology or even creativity? Many scholars, economists and public policy professionals have devoted considerable time on understanding the sources of a nation's prosperity. Some of them opine that economic prosperity arises as a result of ""institutions"" while others argue that factors like endowments and geographic location are equally important. More recently, other scholars believe that productivity is the basis of economic growth and prosperity.  

 

  Recently, scholars like Richard Florida of the Martin Prosperity Institute (MPI) at the University of Toronto have pointed out that the rise of the ""creative class"" could help explain the prosperity and economic development in some parts and the lack of it in other parts of the world. ""Creative class"", according to Florida, is a group of people engaged in creative occupations. These people, when given the right environment and ecosystem, enable innovation, which is the main driving force for economic development.  

 

  Urbanisation and the progress in technology over the past two/three centuries have meant that the flow of ideas and sharing of information can now be done much more quickly. This has led to the rise of the knowledge economy.  

 

  For tracking these developments, Florida and his MPI team have created a Global Creativity Index. The report is based on the 3T framework that forms the basis of economic progress within the city/state -- Tolerance, Talent and Technology -- that in turn leads to economic prosperity. If one looks at the most recent version of the Global Creativity Report 2015 one finds that most developed economies perform well -- Australia is on top, followed by the US, while Singapore, the only Asian nation in the top 10, is at 9, followed by the Netherlands. Also the share of the creative class in many North American and West European countries is closer to 40 percent.  

 

  Contrast this with India's performance -- 99th in a list of 120+ nations -- and there is scope for tremendous improvement. One of the reasons for this low performance is that the share of the creative class is quite low in India. This is due to an issue of quality education and skilling and outflow of people who receive good education. Less than five percent of the Indian workforce is formally skilled. The gross enrolment ratio is also quite low in India.  

 

  India is relatively good in the technology component but bad in the tolerance and talent domains. Even the BRICS as a block is not especially impressive with a diverse range of rankings. Brazil ranks the highest in the Creativity Index within the block at 29. Russia is outstandingly bad in the tolerance aspect.  

 

  The Institute for Competitiveness and Martin Prosperity Institute had previously tied up for research on India's ""Creative Class"". The research and ranking of the Creative Economy of Indian States was done recently.  

 

  The broad findings remain the same as last year. This year we have added a classification of Union Territories and separation from other states.  

 

  Delhi and Chandigarh retain rank 1 and 2, respectively, in the city-states/Union Territory category. Punjab moves to top spot this year from the previous years' third position (in the main states index) pushing down Kerala and Goa. States like Bihar and Orissa are bad performers overall and but have tremendous opportunity to move up in the years to come.  

 

  The maximum negative variation is found in states like Himachal Pradesh, which has moved down six places. Haryana has seen an upward movement of seven places, thus showing significant improvement in performance. States that have moved up in the ranking include Gujarat and Karnataka. The rankings among the Union Territories remained unchanged from the last year.  

 

  In the years ahead, India's economic prosperity will be driven by states and Union Territories and locations and cities within these that are creative. States that do well to foster the creative class will in turn be instrumental in driving innovation and economic progress.

>* We also are aspiring to be a $100 billion sector by 2025,"" Mazumdar-Shaw said.Though this seems a ""fairly daunting task"", she said, adding that ""by investing in human capital and in the sector alone in terms of infrastructure and other research initiatives, I think we can actually deliver on this aspiration.

>* ""Mazumdar-Shaw, also the Chairperson of Karnataka Vision Group on Biotechnology, was speaking at the inauguration of 16th edition of 'Bangalore India Bio 1016' here.The event was also attended by Union Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan and Secretary in Department of Biotechnology K Vijay Raghavan, among others.Stating that India's investment in science and technology is at suboptimal level, she called on the government to invest more.

>* ""We request you (Harsh Vardhan) to push the government to make sure that our investment in science and technology only grows and increases, because this is the future of India, this is what will give us demographic dividend from our scientists,"" she added.The three-day long ""Bangalore India Bio"" will be covering various spectrum of activities including multi track conferences, international trade show, key note talks, poster sessions, bio invest, global biotech conclave, among others.She said to dominate in the field such as biotechnology and information technology what is paramount is human capital, which will actually shape India's science and technology prowess in the world.

Modi's haters will keep scaremongering about how he will start an orgy of Muslim blood and destroy India.

And whenever he proves them wrong(which is always) they will desperately go back and rake up 2002 again.

This will be their fate for the remainder of their natural lives. They will still be talking about 2002 in 2052. Fuck the elections. You want to see who wins? See who's the friendliest towards the West. Which almost always means they ignore the people.

**India and Portugal sign 11 agreements: All you need to know about them** 

 ______ 
India and Portugal recently announced a four million euros joint fund to bolster research in science and technology as Prime Minister Narendra Modi held in-depth talks with his Portuguese counterpart on cooperation in areas like counter-terrorism, space, climate studies and start-ups.

In a joint address to the media after signing 11 bilateral agreements, Modi and Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, who traces his origin to Goa, said the two countries have made substantial progress since Costa visited India in January.

The agreements signed included cooperation in outer space, double taxation avoidance, nano technology, improving cultural ties, youth and sports, higher education, scientific research, and setting up of a Portugal-India Business Hub and an Indian Chamber of Commerce.

How will these pacts benefit India?

These pacts are expected to promote India's ties with Portugal towards the establishment of a unique centre on the Azores Archipelago -- the Atlantic International Research Centre, which will act as an innovation hub for trans-atlantic and north-south cooperation

The goal of the Centre is to provide a shared environment to foster new climate, earth, space and marine research

With respect to space, cooperation is expected to include development and cooperation of next generation nano and micro satellites

On marine sciences, the project would enable India to study the atmospheric and ocean behaviour of the Atlantic and its linkages with weather patterns including the monsoon

On joint science and technology fund of 4 million euros:

Speaking on collaboration in cutting-edge technology, Modi announced the setting up of a joint science and technology fund of four million euros. ""Our economic ties continue to follow an upward trajectory, and we can do more for the flow of goods, services, capital and human resources,"" he said, adding that bilateral trade has grown 17 per cent in the past one year.

""We look forward to engaging with Portugal in the Atlantic International Research Centre, both in the Space and Ocean Science fields,"" Modi added.

Other MoUs signed:

Protocol amending the Double Taxation Aviodance Agreement

MoU on Nano Technology MoU on Public Administration and Governance Reforms

MoU on Cultural Cooperation

MoU on Youth and Sports

MoU between Portugal India Business Hub and Indian Chamber of Commerce

MoU on Cooperation in the fields of Higher Education and Scientific Research

KOLKATA: A 14-year-old has wowed cityscientistswith her discovery of the impact of the 'Om' sound in reducing fatigue.Anwesha Roy Chowdhury, a Class-IX student ofAdamas World School, topped the recently heldScience Congressorganized by the state government.



Her findings that chanting of 'Om' increases oxygen level in blood and lowers carbon dioxide and lactic acid, which reduces the level of fatigue, were vetted by physics and physiology professors of Calcutta University andJadavpur University. Debashish Bandopadhyay, head of the department of physiology, Calcutta University, told TOI, ""Anwesha's project is innovative, it's quite flawless and convincing.""



An-we-sha, who likes to spell her name thus, since anweshan in Bengal means 'search', told TOI, ""I found that sounds with a particular frequency, if heard or recited right, raises the level of neurotransmitters and hormones like serotonin, dopamine, DHEA etc. Because of their vasodilatory actions, the oxygen level in blood soars. It also produces less lactic acid and allows the person to act without fatigue.""



""In the last decade, the body of research on workout music has swelled considerably, helping psychologists refine their ideas about why exercise and music are such an effective pairing. But this specific finding on the 'Om' sound is impressive,"" said Rina Venkataraman, secretary, state science and technology department.



""No one has ever pin-pointed on the 'Om' sound and conducted such comprehensive experiments on its use,"" Dipankar Das, senior scientist, state science and technology department, said during a workshop conducted on 165 students who were shortlisted for the statewide Science Congress recently.



It all began when Anwesha visited Uttarakhand, where she ""found some priests carrying water from Bageshwar to Kedarnath, covering 68km every day, without tiring. The priests sang a tune all along. There was no way she could reproduce the same mantra for her experiments. So Anwesha started looking for a similar tune.



""Finally, a tune with 430+ Hz frequency clicked. In five experiments in various laboratories, I measured the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels of 17 adults (all on the staff of BITM) while listening to the tune for 30 minutes, and there was an increase of oxygen level and decrease in carbon dioxide in their bodies,"" Anwesha said.

**In turn the universities must also subscribe to highest standards of academic excellence and accountability**, Modi said.

We'll have to wait to find out what that emboldened bit means in terms of specifics I guess...

On the administrative policy aspect

> ""As the major source of science and technology, government must do its part. When I speak of ease of doing business in India, I also want to pay equal attention to the ease of doing research and development in India,"" Modi said.

and

>**The Prime Minister said each government department should have an officer focusing on science and technology relating to its area of work and, allocate a percentage of its budget for such activities.**

(Awesome!)

and

>""We have to place the university system at the cutting edge of the research and development activities in the country,"" he added.

... as opposed to moribund government institutes? Cool. One difference being access to student population, and their talents. This demographic is still unencumbered by the livelihood phase, and is living in a setting where their only real responsibility is to learn. (Leading to a system where enthusiasm is fostered, rather than let wither)

Moving on... the PM, *possibly* on the parenting and socio-cultural aspect, says

>Emphasising the need to popularise science and technology, he said, ""Our children should see role models in scientists as much as in sportsmen.""

&
 
>""You will have no better supporter than me. In turn, I seek your help in transforming India,"" Modi said as he told the scientific community that their achievements should be celebrated ""as much as we rejoice in our success in other areas"".
""We need to put science, technology and innovation at the top of national priorities. Above all, we must restore the pride and prestige of science and scientists in our nation,"" the Prime Minister said.

A re-iteration of the publicly-acknowledged (though spurned in private) view. I still would like someone to simply pitch the awesomeness of science to the public - as a standalone... and not tied to pride, or its use for development, or national supremacy... but I guess this'll do for now.

Modi on the legislative policy aspect.

>He also called for clear regulatory policies for research and development in areas like biotechnology, nano-science, agriculture and clinical research.

There are other issues too, but his mention has now gotten me thinking: what is the Hindu religion stand on stem-cell research? (Or abortion for that matter?) Or genetic modification etc. etc.?

The PM's other observations in the developmental/fiscal/economical aspects

>A nation's progress and development is linked to science, Modi said.

&

>The Prime Minister called upon Indian industry to step up investments in science and technology in its own interest.

&

> **He said India's own pharmaceutical industry has carved out a place for itself in the world, because it invests significantly in research.**

(Are you listening, industry?)

>China's emergence as the second biggest economy is parallel to that country's strides in science and technology, he added.

The usual stuff, but I think I hear Western Pharma company CEOs, the WTO, and western patent lawyers turning in their graves. (They can continue to do so AFAI'm concered though). But yes, do Indian pharma firms really invest that much in R&D? As in IP generating R&D? As opposed to number-crunching processing/experimentation centres that use cheaper labour, without requiring this labour to do their own directed thinking.

Anyway, he goes on to recognise the historical approach to S&T policy, as well as offer his two cents.

>Modi asked the scientists to incorporate traditional local knowledge to develop more appropriate, effective, sustainable and affordable technologies that contribute immensely to development and progress.
He said the arms of science, technology and innovation must reach the poorest, the remotest and the most vulnerable person.
The PM also felicitated Nobel laureates and Indian scientists on the occasion.

It would be illuminating to have regular discussions on advanced scientific and engineering research, in the context of India, and amongst the reddit-faring desi junta and interested non-Indians.
 
The topics of discussions could be anything from in-depth technical discussions and debates on a particular research topic, a paper, a government or corporate project to scientific policy, funding & related issues, tips for new researchers etc, if it is spearheaded by Indians (at home or abroad) or is being conducted in India as a part of a global collaboration (e.g., INO).

I am in two minds about what would be a good place for this. One on hand, having a separate subreddit sounds like a good idea to consolidate and stay focused. However, in my experience most Indian subreddits other than randia don't really get much traction and end up dying. I think the goal of such discussions should not only be exchange of ideas and information amongst researchers, but also with a larger audience. Given that /r/India is the largest, most cohesive (heh) agglomeration of desis on reddit, perhaps a discussion thread once/twice a month would be better. Of course, the format and the discussion topics would be more restrained in those threads and won't really be a free-for-all.

Learning Hadoop is *Learning a technology* while learning Distributed Computing/Architecture is learning a science/concept. Why am I stressed on making the distinction? Science/concepts remains but technologies change. It's easier to switch between technologies if you know the science. Vice-versa is possible but difficult.

Since you started the Intro to Data Science on Coursera; Bill Howes from University of Washington (instructor) stressed on this aspect too. Which city are you from? We have a Hyderabad Data Science group (google search for details), I think there is a similar one in Bangalore. No clue about other cities. If you can follow a degree on machine learning, data mining or statistics ( or mathematics ) you would be suited for big data analytics. To be honest, I donot have any knowledge of industry certification; most of my knowledge is from academia. 
In academia, analysis of extremely large data sets , like Facebook, has been studied for some time.  Why did you stop the class last time? And also are you currently employed? Cos Coursera is offering Data Science specialisation and it costs approx 30K. If you can spend weekly 5-6 hours for each 3 courses, you can finish this specialisation within 6-7 months. All the best!

Even I am interested in data and classes commence from April 7th. Enrolled into 3 courses as of now. Paid $150.  screw most of the advice here, so far.

Just do statistics,statistics and more statistics.  At least upto t-tests, F scores.  

Do not worry about hadoop.  Know your stats and numbers; they'll be enough AP guys to code for you in hadoop.

Maths, you either get it or you don't.

Extraordinarily brilliant research scholars are rotting away their lives in dingy labs even after the stipulated 5 year time frame for PhD studies, sometimes due to department policy that sets a limit to the number of PhDs that can be awarded in an academic year, but more often due to Profs not wanting to let go of the hardworking youngsters who churn out 4 to 5 technical papers every year! There are many PhD scholars who are married, have kids and dependent parents. Bureaucracy is oblivious to their struggle to make ends meet with the meagre 18000 stipend they get every month! Lack of funding and collaboration with industries cripple the situation even more. A certain Professor, when made head of division, cut off all industrial collaboration and consultancy works that used to fetch a neat income to the department on account of ""trust deficit"".

What I would like to add is that most Bengalis even today grow up with a completely different picture of Ramayana. Most of us have studied Michael's MeghnadVadh Kavya in school, which paints a contrasting picture of Rama and Laxmana. We have been taught to sympathise with Meghanada and not Laxmana - Laxmana was the bad guy!

Even the original Krittibashi Ramayana portrays Rama differently than the original Valmiki Ramayana - the Bengali version is heavily influenced by the Bhakti movement and thus portrays Rama as more of a family man and cuts out lot of the violence.

Another point, in the legend of Durga Puja, Durga literally slays a buffalo! Still today in some parts of Bengal a buffalo or more commonly a goat is sacrificed during the Puja. Trying convincing the North Indians to do this! Similarly vegetarianism is not Hindu Culture.

That could be Brahmanism or something else

I will eat Beef, Pork, carrot whatever I want. This religion does not really control your eating habits.

If someone wants to be vegetarian then they are free to avoid meat.

However why the fuck do they stop others from consuming Beef? This is not related to Hinduism at all

We never stop them from drinking Gomutra. 2 liter piyo, Mujhe kya

Some dumbfucks with a political agenda are trying to hijack Hinduism BJP is over ‘Vande Mataram' because they themselves can't recite the whole song. >I have heard numerous people, including my relatives, complain how non-Bengalis are taking over Bengal and we need to stop it (yeah, I know it is kind of discriminatory but I have heard this a lot).

Blatant bigotry is never acceptable, but any minority or migrant community has to do their part in going the extra mile to be good residents, and to assimilate with modern society. On the flip side the host population should also be helpful towards minorities and migrants and give them whatever assistance they need to be productive citizens.

Certains sections of the twitterati get triggered when you even mention shitty behavior from some sections of society, but hatred towards BIMARU people festers when people see things like this. Similarly when muslims block roads and have prayer on loudspeakers that wakes people up people get annoyed (just as they should with bihari bhajans). Similarly with jains and certain kinds of pure-veg upper caste non-bengalis, their imposition of eggless/meatless in housing communities and the proliferation of restaurants pandering to them is also irritating.

The woke crowd of the modern SJW movement has this weird gospel where you aren't even allowed to criticize shitty behavior from any community. And any generalization is absolutely fascism.

This is extremely self-defeating since you're shutting down 100% valid criticism of bad behavior.

It goes like this:

far left: X community does no wrong, they are not backwards. How you see them is more important than what you actually do (fringe ideas, but the woke left is slowly creeping into the mainstream)

center left: X community is underprivileged and hence 
backwards and regressive, so we should help them as much as possible. They need to integrate.

center right: X community is regressive, they need to stop being regressive. They need to assimilate. We will help them, but not much and they aren't really entitled to anything. And then something something market forces will sort it out.

far right:  X community needs to be subjugated, expelled or eliminated (this is gradually entering the mainstream unfortunately)

Populist politics favors the far-left or the far right. More liberal and neoliberal politics keeps politics in the more sensible center-left and center-right, and that's a debate that *should* happen.

Unfortunately this spectrum doesn't really apply in India, and everything is much further right. We don't really have a debate around the center. In fact that kind of debate is more at home in the western world - but even there it is unfortunately getting hijacked with populist nonsense. You don't really find woke leftists in India outside of some very irrelevant twitter fringes, and most of Indian social media is ridiculously far right by western standards.

>BJP is hell bent on imposing Hindi and 'Jai Shri Ram' on the face of all Hindus. But that is just not the reality. Many Hindus don't (and don't want to) speak Hindi or pray to Ram or are interested in what happens in Ayodhya.

I have a feeling the hindutva project wants to homogenize India, and hinduism; most of the shakhas indoctrinate kids into their ideology. Quite a few bengali families are starting to get 'marwarified' - they join in with diwali instead of kali puja, holi instead of dol, hanuman chalisa and even bhajans. But broadly yes of course Amartya Sen is right.

Politics in WB other than that is sadly less about politics and ideology and more about whose thugs are stronger. That's the current battle to be honest. Never heard of Jai shri ram chants growing up in Bangalore. If I hear people shouting Jai shri ram around me now, which seems more and more probable, I would assume troublemakers are up to no good, and take it as a signal to vacate the area as soon as possible. Joy maa kaali What pisses me off the most is seeing how a bunch of politically opportunistic Bengalis like Dilip Ghosh are busy shoving down the narrative that 'Joy Shree Ram' has always been a part of Bengali culture, and people seem to be lapping it up! I would rather give up my Hindu identity than give up my Bengali identity. To me, a beef-eating Bengali Muslim is much more close than a vegetarian Hindu from Haryana or UP. I can relate more with a Bengali irrespective of his/her faith than a Hindu from another region. I am a Bengali first. BJP rule would rob every Bengali of his/her identity because it would impose the non-Bengali culture and values on Bengalis to make us Bengalis better Hindus. This will create a situation that was seen in East-Pakistan during the 1960s in which North Indian Muslims who immigrated to Pakistan tried to make Bengalis a better Muslim. North Indians (be they Hindu or Muslim) always had this superiority complex and they always tried to dominate Bengalis. Rule of BJP in Bengal = Dominance of North Indians. We will fight tooth and nail to thwart these imbeciles. >BJP is hell bent on imposing Hindi and 'Jai Shri Ram' on the face of all Hindus.

Not just hindus, and they're managing to do it. This country is going down the drain. Watch out for increasing violence and conflict if you haven't noticed already. So who else thinks there that there'll be large scale communal riots in WB before the elections? This is why I tell my friends BJP is a bigger threat to Hinduism than any secular parties.


Usually Polytheistic religions are more tolerant than monotheistic religions (especially Abrahamic religions) because they don't believe in 'One and only god' notion. That's what has kept Hinduism alive. Hinduism can take within itself disparate practices and influence other religions as well. (eg) Sufi Islam which is the reason why Indian Muslims number very few among terrorists compared to their huge numbers. 

By making Hinduism about one cause (Ram Temple) BJP is doing what people might call 'Abrahamification of Hinduism'. They polarize the country, kill people and justify the same in the name of religion (like it's a 'crusade'). Why is that these riots don't take place in TN or Kerala? Aren't they Hindus? 

Lot of important idols (especially from Chola era) in temples from Tamil Nadu villages were looted by Subash Kapoor who made a living out of it. Isn't this cause important for Hinduism? And yet I don't see BJP hitting the streets for it. Would it's reaction been the same if that guy was non-Hindu? It doesn't give a shit because this wouldn't fetch votes. 

By making it one God & one cause BJP is harming Hinduism. I hope right-thinking Hindus realize this and start rescuing their religion from BJP. There is however a very interesting connection that Bengalis do have with Lord Rama. We celebrate Durga Puja during Autumn/Hemanata but Durga is usually worshipped during Spring.

The practice that we follow is known as Akal Bodhan and was actually started by Lord Rama. Akal Bodhan refers to the uncustomary invoking of the Goddess. Rama did it to seek her blessings in his battle against Ravana. During the ceremonies, she is usually offered a flower known as sthal-padma (or the land lotus), a flower which blooms on the land but looks like the lotus. It's supposed to be a substitute for the lotus since it doesn't bloom in autumn, and it is supposed to be symbolic of Lord Rama's eye which he had offered to the Goddess. 

I find it strange that this tidbit is missing from the conversation. Basically what I'm trying to say is that Ram chanted Jay Ma Durga and so do Bengalis. These Bhakts need to do their homework.

Edit: One of the biggest and most popular ceremonies during Durga Puja is the ""shondi-pujo"" which is usually performed during the transition period between Ashtami and Navami. It's supposed to be a very auspicious hour and it is said that Ram was able to vanquish Ravana exactly at this juncture. I think Bangalis are probably the biggest Rambhakts on the planet and yet we don't feel the need to chant Jay Shree Ram. BJP basically missed an opportunity. Suorer baccha... Hahahaha You are giving BJP pro-tips so they can make use of it, then enter Bengal and then screw you up your backside too? Man, you are too generous!

The homogenisation of people is every ruler's dream. People who speak the same language and worship the same god are much easier to control, i.e., manipulate. The BJP is not doing it to benefit Bengal, or any other part of the country. The main agenda is only to benefit itself.

People are so busy discussing this whole Hindutva stuff all the time, there is all sorts of other nonsense going on which is relatively unnoticed. The government said it will generate revenue from data to shore up its bottom line. And this week, we are told proudly that the vehicle registration and driving license data of Indian citizens is being sold to private companies. Just one example. Here is the thing though: polytheism does not say that other gods are false, even outside of the pantheon. The general belief is in the patrons god (s) of the land. Say if someone worships Apollo in Greece, Mars in Rome they would have no problem at all in coming here and worshipping Aiyappa in Bangalore or Ram in Ayodhya. 

We do have the same pantheon, and although the patron gods of Bengal is based on Shaktism, there are huge probabilities of crossover.

To Bengalis I say this: Greet and Pray (or dont) as you always have. Nobody cares but some uneducated fringe. Jai Shri Ram has a more political meaning here than a religious one. ",1562955342.0,1,76,0,90,"Sorry for posting about this so late. Wanted to, but had exams. Plus, I am shocked that this incident wasn't posted here by anybody while right wingers are bashing him calling him a 'leech' and 'trying to divide India'.

I am a Bengali. No, I ain't 'proud' of my culture. I don't believe you can be proud of something you got just by being born. Nor do I think Bengalis or Bengali culture is somewhat superior to other cultures. But here is the thing - 'Jai Shri Ram' isn't our culture. 'Jai Ma Durga/Kali' is.

I have observed that BJP/right-wingers have a belief that only their (central/North Indian) version of Hinduism is the only Hinduism. They completely ignore Eastern and Southern versions of it. They have trouble understanding the fact that Hinduism is an umbrella term for ALL religions in pre-British era India. Their obsession with Ram Mandir is a proof of it. From my experience, Hindus of South India and Eastern India have almost no interest in a Ram Mandir. Bengali Hindus mostly follow and believe in Shaktism, in Durga/Kali and our culture has been mainly influenced by Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and Sarada trio. And we have our temple - the Dakshineshwar temple. Odisha has Jaganath temple, a large temple, visited by millions of people around India. In South India, they have Tirumala, another huge temple with millions of devotees. Then you have Sabarimala, in the North you have the famous Amarnath temple, which attract a lot of pilgrims. Every part of India have their own favourite 'god'. In Hinduism, it says God is one but is worshiped in different forms by different rituals. Everyone has their own versions and they are devoted to them. I would argue, not a lot of Hindus are really into Ram to be honest. Of course, all Hindus respect Ram and believe he is an avatar, but not that important as a deity to worship.

Now, don't get me wrong, there are a lot of Marwaris, Biharis, etc here in Bengal and a lot of them say 'Jai Shri Ram'. Bengalis do respect their beliefs and often say 'Yeah, jai shri Ram' in response. But that's it. Anyone will devote themselves more to Kali/Durga rather than Ram here in Bengal.

It will sound really rude and discriminatory but I will say this very clearly - Hindi-speakers are that much foreign to many conservative Bengalis as are, say, Rohingyas to Indians. Why? Language barrier. We do not speak the same language. Hindi and its accent is difficult to imitate for many Bengalis. Our cultures are different. Many of our cuisines are different. Our ceremonies are different. Our attires are often different. A 'royal and rich' Marwari house is very different from a 'bonedi rich' Bengali house. I have heard numerous people, including my relatives, complain how non-Bengalis are taking over Bengal and we need to stop it (yeah, I know it is kind of discriminatory but I have heard this a lot). I mean heck, even our classic slangs are different.

BJP is hell bent on imposing Hindi and 'Jai Shri Ram' on the face of all Hindus. But that is just not the reality. Many Hindus don't (and don't want to) speak Hindi or pray to Ram or are interested in what happens in Ayodhya. The entrance of BJP in West Bengal has been more or less the same way TMC came into power - being out of options. CPM was a terrible choice for Bengal and the only option then was TMC. So, they rose to power. Now that BJP is in power and TMC and CPM both are terrible (Congress has been an unpopular choice), BJP is the only option. Plus, many of the BJP's members, like Locket Chatterjee, are very active here and does a lot of work for the people. But I don't think people of Bengal are really interested in this whole 'Hindutva/Hindi/Ram' thing.

A tip for BJP: If you want a good entrance here in Bengal you have to say 'Jai Ma' and 'Suorer baccha' first.","In my opinion, Amartya Sen is right about 'Jai Shri Ram' not being a Bengali culture"

Honestly, he should resign. 

INC is in need of a new face, a leader who can stand up to the likes of Modi and Shah which is an extremely challenging task in itself, RaGa just isn’t capable of doing that. 

I don’t like Modi, but I don’t hate him either. He projected himself not only as a politician, but as a genuine leader... 

I feel quite sad for RaGa today, but the reality is, he just doesn’t have what it takes to be a politician..

*Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be. The measure of a person, is how well they succeed at being who they are.* I think the only way INC’s dynastic hegemony will end is if they suffer successive defeats in the elections reducing their relevance. They did not learn from 2014 mandate and they will not learn from 2019. 

It is ridiculous that a pan india party wins seats less than local parties. 

I think we will see more of the MGB style alliances forming to be a viable opposition front rather than a strong single pan india opposition party which is not optimal because you have ragtag mix of local parties without a uniform agenda that can potentially take on power at center. At this point anyone who wants RaGa to stay as head of congress is actually bjp supporters..

Seriously though modi have some much to thank him. Because of RaGa today NDA have the biggest mandate since 1984!!! 

How can anyone screw this badly is beyond me..any common rickshaw driver might actually be better politician than RaGa CWC won’t accept it . Mummy ko resignation dega kya Forget offering to resign. He should just do it. He has offered in the past too. It's high time the Gandhi family learn their lesson. What's the minimum number of seats to be leader of opposition? Is RaGa at least getting that? /s Can't get over these incompetent fucks who can't pose a fucking challenge to the incumbent government. We deserve a better opposition than these one-family ass licking politicians. He hasn't offered anything. He has immediately started working on helping BJP win in 2024

First party president who helped opposition party win twice!! Here's a conspiracy theory: Rahul Gandhi is a BJP implant to destroy Congress from within. 😆 Fun Fact: If you catch a train from Churchgate(Mumbai) station and travel towards North. The first Congress MP you will find is in Punjab. It was rejected by Sonia gandhi DO IT. PLEASE. I BEG YOU. It’s about time He was the media's darling Prince ready to take the throne of the Prime Minister's office a decade ago. It's funny how the Congress and its media machine projects him as PM material when he's not had to work an honest day's work his whole life and has no street smarts or book smarts whatsoever. Drama What on earth is *offering* to the resign? Just do it, and take your entitled brat sister along with you. Rahul Gandhi to reject Rahul Gandhi's resignation. Offers!! this guy should retire and go abroad before he do anymore damage. High time. He needs to resign. And other leaders of congress should be demanding it by now. Please leave! Let someone competent take the helm. The ground that will be be disappointed by this the most is the BJP I'm not fully up to speed with Indian politics, however isn't it generally normal in democracies for a party leader to resign if he/she suffers a near electoral wipeout? Looking at Indian election results it looks like the Indian National Congress lost 79% of their 206 seats at the 2014 General Election, so how was it possible for Shree Rahul Gandhi to remain leader? You would surely think that the grassroots or the principal donors would effectively force the former leader out, right? Please get the message already!  
The people don't see RaGa as a potential PM, you've lost once, lost twice.  
Change the face of your party and please it not be a family INC will dissolve without a Gandhi. It is a fact. 

And also the current Gandhi will be it's downfall.

Either way INC is dead. After losing the elections, when you have the matters to fight elections which can lead to lose for BJP.

I think that RaGa should step down. This will send a positive message to the voters who have mindset of Nepotism & Congress. He should work in party but he should also give chance to new politicians Thing is, people are automatically attracted to strength, boldness and ferociousness in a leader, no matter what development he does/doesn't do.  
  
To defeat Modi, u need his equal in personality. RaGa may be a decent PM but he is a wet tissue in personality compared to Modi. If Rahul had any chance, Congress would have faired better

Please do your self a favour, retire and go live your life.  If Congress has no other leader to replace Rahul, then it should be doomed Congress is a franchise model political party, the Gandhi’s are the brand name and policy bearers of the company, the state leaders have their own company and supporters and use the franchise.

The Gandhi’s do not allow the franchisees to gain too much power, for example Rajasekar Reddy of AP who was very powerful and called the shots, Siddaramiah too is powerful.

So since the Gandhi’s have the brand and goodwill and it franchises it to a local leader in return for funds, power and cadre Human Resources.

Hence no Gandhi’s will relinquish their leadership position, and no franchisees will accept a no brand leader from top, and voters too will not vote for Congress unless it’s lead by Gandhi’s.

Hence the term greedy as a pig. In a scenario rahul might step down, he needs to make sure someone worthy gets the mantle. Otherwise the congress might just implode like what happened to the aiadmk in tamil nadu.

I really do hope he resigns from the top post. He did the best he can this time but the results hardly changed compared to last time. Radical changes are needed to change the fortunes of the congress party in 2024. It is extremely dangerous to let the BJP have absolute majority especially with modi-shah’s aggresive immoral tactics to stay in power. Same old modus operandi. Sigh.

India public like leaders who can make them feel like they're someone great and proud ( even if it's just false dream ) .Modi can do that, Rahul can't. INC need the same type of leader. Rahul wasn't bult for politics. He's a nice person I'm sure but he doesn't have the quick wits, or the farsight to be in politics. Should have done it 5 years ago, I'm not a BJP supporter and voting for a regional party is fucking pointless in national election and Congress gave absolutely no reason to vote for them As much as I admire him as a person, he's no match for Amit Shah. He should straight up quit the post instead of all this offering resignation crap. Haha, that snake will say anything, but never resign ### another PR stunt, he will submit they wont accept. Fuck with this all BS. Finally About time. Please do. Palpatine voice: Dewit! Okay whatever it is, what the f is that photo? Gandhi-mukt Congress? Might have a fighting chance next time around... Tomorrow, Rahul gandhi will give his resignation to Rahul gandhi which will be rejected by Rahul gandhi because Rahul gandhi says resignation is not a solution of problems created by Rahul gandhi.

Rahul Gandhi then will request Rahul Gandhi to continue to guide the Congress which Rahul Gandhi will accept and will thank Rahul Gandhi for reposing faith in Rahul Gandhi. Guys how long are we going to allow the media to control our conversations with their ""sources""? lol. WTF is this ‘offer’ to resign?  Just resign and go away, because one has to search really hard to an equally ineffective leader. They wanted to win on an Anti-Modi sentiment but ironically lost to an Anti-Rahul mandate. If congress wants to survive it needs to leave the Gandhis alone and get more capable leaders on the front. And definitely stop this drama of getting sympathy for Rahul. Rahul go back I hope Shashi Tharoor becomes the new leader. Why offer? Just resign. If everyone in the country had 10 paise for every time this guy offered to resign, then there would be no need for the 15 lakhs in bank account. Just do it! -nike ""offers"" like he's doing a favor to the country. 

Let him be there. It could be a major turn in Indian politics where unaware people genuinely understand that family lineage doesn't deserve shit. Usual nautanki. He didn't had any remorse on his face. He and his sister were smiling like nothing happened. Ye Kam election se pahle karna cahiye tha, ab Kya fayda. It would be wrong to say that congress is any nationalists now.

Don't give me history of party ,just facts, you try to get voters and inititae himdu terro at the front to appease them, what morons do you  think indians are.

You contest a guy who was dancing with half naked girls against pragya, who was given clean chit by ec, you had lil knowledge of rafale, and sc gave clean chit to it,so you fund your party lawyers to reopen the case the goto ralies to and say, ""look ,sc opened the case once again, they might have found modi guilty"" 

Last but not least, you were having anti-india imgae when you questioned indian army .

You deserved it. I think it was just a PR move. Rahul Gandhi is critical for India's success. His presence keeps the deeply corrupt Congress away from power. It's high time now.congress needs to project someone who is strong and capable I am resigning,and I appoint didi or mummy as the new chief until we get some success then I will be back as chief again and will get lauded for revival of congress.And then again we will appoint a PM who has to toe the party lines, doesn't matter if he looks weak.

Then we will lose few elections,come back riding the anti incumbency wave and cycle will go on. Gandu going? Oh no! Yayyy!! He should resign without any nautanki and take her mother, sister and brother-in-law with him. Let Congress fall apart, and use it as an opportunity to make this party from ground up again. They have to stop applying bandaids to deep wounds.

Congress is doomed till this family is at helm. Rahul Gandhi has absolutely nothing to show for except big words. A borderline voter would never take chance with him, they would rather vote for a regional party than him.

I think Congress is important for India but not in present state and definitely not with Gandhi family in charge. We need a Congress party that's rooted in socially and economically progressive ideals, and have people that have made their way up top organically. Until then, he will have to keep giving such bogus resignations. I hope Congress doesn't take any hasty decisions. The Gandhi family is what is holding the party together. With that said I think Priyanka is a better fit to lead the party. I lost my 72000k He will offer it to the Congress committee. He is the President, but there is a committee of senior people such as Digvijay Singh, Shashi Tharoor, Ashok Gehlot, etc. who shall be consulted. There is a huge gap for a center right, unabashedly capitalist party that doesn't shy away from being seen as pro-Hindu in India.

For all practical purposes, BJP is silly socialist. Their fiscal agenda is no different from that of Congress. 

If the Congress can dump the Gandhis, move to the right, be secular (that doesn't mean pandering to the minorities and hosting Iftaar parties), they have a strong chance in 2024. I wonder when people in Congress realize that the Gandhi-Vadra complex is a massive liability for them. Offers! The entitled prince has ...OMG.... OFFERED!

Thank you prince .... thank you for your generous offer to resign. Hi, I am not an Indian but I trade Emerging market indices which got me interested in this elections. We view continuation of existing regimes as bullish. Most folks seem to be bullish that Modi will continue economic reforms, although the recent intervention in Central Banker RBI wasn't viewed favorably.

I am curious about the opposition party, which seems to be an arm of a single family since inception? Usually when you lose back to back elections, a rebel more extreme wing develops which tries to take control of the party (like how alt right took control of Republican Party through Trump, an outsider).

Is there any such group within Congress and what are the chances they can take control from existing group and attempt to win next elections (or midterms if such an event exists).

Thanks. Now I can live peacefully for another 5 years. Unless this nincompoop decides to run for the PMs post again. RaGa should dig in and hold his ground. He should choose a more prominent face like Tharoor or Chidambar as a PM candidate next time and retain his position as the party chief. Just like how Sonia did in UPA1/2. If a 4th standard pass guy can run this country.. really anyone can. Besides BJP knows how to win elections but to deliver concrete economic building measures is an all together different ball game. How long will they fudge data? This is the perfect time to start a change.org to have a likable figure like captain Amrinder or Tharoor as president of the party. Someone please do that. When I saw his speech conceding defeat, despite myself I felt bad for him. I think he knows he's not cut out for politics and wants out, and his offer to resign is genuine, but his family and party won't let him.

For what it's worth I think underneath all this he's someone who genuinely wants to do good even though his politics, policies and party are all wrong.

I wouldn't vote for him now, but given his (relative) youth he's likely to become PM some day, be it 2024 or 2029. And I think I'd be fine with that. I feel congress bartered its seats to save robert vadra and also 2 defamation cases filed on them by anil ambani and adani

How come just a day before anil ambani took the case back and today adani ? 😏 He sounds like the Hillary Clinton of India To be honest, I for whatever reason want to see Rahul Gandhi at higher power (or maybe a PM one day) but for that to happen, he needs to get his shit together. He needs to actually work for this stuff (the same kind of activeness that was observed the past few months) consistently for the next 5 years. [deleted] Rahul has plenty of time left to strengthen his base become PM in his life unlike Modi who used all his resources to get the PM-ship lol. Chill guys.

>The Opposition has more PM aspirants but the focus now is on keeping the flock together




https://m.telegraphindia.com/india/mayawati-to-back-opposition-coalition-if-made-pm/cid/1691039 National Herald is unironically calling it a [moral victory](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/amp/story/opinion%2Fnot-a-ruthless-election-machine) for RaGa. 🤦‍♂️

Looks like the next elections will deliver a Congress mukt bharat. Wasn't the social media manager of Congress going to do 1 more ama after the results? Things opposition has to improve :

1. They need to get rid of nepotism, at least at the top. Most of parties in MGB are dynastic and have history of corruption. Do away with old guard and bring in some fresh blood and ideas. To do that these parties will have to adopt an internal constitution and processes to ensure rise of meritorious candidates. Currently, it seems impossible. 

 

2. Embrace true secularism i.e. stop pandering to a community for votebank. Support secular Uniform civil code and be adamant at separation of governance and religion.  

 

3. Do good work at the states where they are in power. Stop fighting elections on the failures of Modi, fight elections on your merits. 
 


4. Opposition also needs to identify the rotten apples and distance itself from them. Mamata has shown dictatorial tendencies and her party is famed for its use of violence. No need to establish ties with her. She will bring you down with her. Enemy of enemy is my friend doesn't apply in politics. Aligning with someone who has contrasting vision and aspirations sends mixed signals to the voter. 


5. Have a vision paper based on development, progress, true secularism, equality , national security and climate. Fighting elections purely on caste equations and quota promises will only get this far. Room for Caste politics is diminishing and in next 20 years, may start to become irrelevant. 


I can see opposition embracing 3 and 4, but not 1 and 2, therefore the opposition loses might keep on piling.


Edit : Added point 5


Edit 2: I voted for BJP because to me the alternative was a coalition of dynastic regional parties with history of corruption such as RJD, SP, BSP, DMK, CBN's party, TMC and that would have been catastrophic for our nation. 

If political parties implement the amendments that I have stated, then we have an excellent opportunity to elevate the political discourse and improve the governance. I don't favour any party. But this is bad for India, not because BJP got elected. But because there is a non-existent opposition party. Too much power at one party didn't always bode well for India.


One good thing about this election: dynasty politics getting obliterated.  \-Narendra Modi finishes thanking supporters and world leaders.

&#x200B;

  \-Fully tired, slumps on a couch to rest.

&#x200B;

  \-Amit Shah arrives and hands him a paper.

&#x200B;

  Modi- Ye kya hai? 

&#x200B;

  Amit Shah- Maharashtra aur Haryana assembly election me rallies ka schedule hai, we start tomorrow morning.

Copypasta from Insta, found it funny so..... Rahul's resignation rejected.

Well, fuck. I believe Congress, SP, BSP etc all need fresh faces at the top. Rahul and Akhilesh bhaiyya are memes. Notice how the final results are yet to be formally declared - as of 12pm , 24th May. This is because of verifying of VVPAT slips from 5 random EVMs from each constituency. No reports of any discrepancy yet. I hope this ends the EVM discussion. Why BJP Won:   
(Numbers from BJP President's press conference)

\- 3 Years of preparation (From January 2016)  
\- 3000 full time on ground workers focusing on Lok Sabha & Vidhan Sabha constituencies for the last two years  
\- 18 National level committees headed by senior ministers  
\- 29 State level committees involving 435 senior leaders.  
\- 482 Constituency level committees having 7,230 karyakartas in positions of responsibility  
\- 11 crore registered karyakartas (expanded from 2.5 crores in 2014)  
\- 161 Call Centers providing backup support for the last 6 months to karyakartas engaged in a campaign to reach 24 crores 81 lakh people

Ideology is important.   
Social media reach is important.   
Arguments and rants are important.   
But nothing can substitute the impact of pure hard work done meticulously. I have a question. Why do people of Punjab vote for Congress and not BJP unlike other North Indian states? One thing is clear from the comments in this post: quite a few people misinterpret democracy as ""whatever I think good"" and intelligence as ""agreeing with me"". Daenerys Targaryens are abundant. I dont wana jump anybody. Just curious.

Rajasthan has ruling party Congress, still how did they not win even one seat?? This is the best result that could have happened. UPA sucks real bad, plus they don't bring anything to the table. Voting for UPA  just means voting for one family with only a vision to get re elected, nothing for the nation. The congress should ditch the Gandhis if it wants to have any future. My generation has no place in our hearts for them quite simply.  

As for a strong opposition,  AAP made that space, credible with decent faces and leaders. If Kejriwal had not made stopping the BJP his only agenda and concentrated on expanding only his party, probably made a 20 year roadmap, We could have a good left face to BJPs right. A two party system which would have the complete range of ideological offerings. Non-Indian leftist here, I heard from a friend that a big part of Modi's win was his successful electrification/running water projects in poorer areas, which made up for the weaker macroeconomic factors. How much truth is there to this? I am kind of surprised that why some people (read opposition) was not able to gauge the scale of the expected win.I mean Modi may not be an autocrat but he seems to get some shit done. Ujjwala Yojna ,Mudra Yojna and PM-KISAN were delivered to people in much more efficient way than the past precedence. In India, people want to give second chance to the one who seems to do things. [removed] [**Not more than 250 for NDA, was my secret wish: Jagan**](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/not-more-than-250-for-nda-was-my-secret-wish-jagan-736218.html)

Lol. I like that he's so open about it. I suspect there were several other regional leaders that were hoping for a similar outcome for an entry into the NDA. KCR, Naveen Patnaik, maybe even MK Stalin and Mayawati.  PM-Kisan for farmers and Ujjwala scheme  were two main schemes which created a strong under current for BJP even in those states which the party recently lost and also Ayushman bharat is also popular among lower income group people ,Modi not only able to kick off these schemes but also able to take them to people directly  like in our house maid was happy and in village women were happy by getting gas cylinders instead of daily cow-dung cakes process.Same goes with PM-Kisan farmers received their 1st installment directly in their accounts before elections. This is what happens when you have no credible opposition and a bunch of corrupt to the core and greedy regional parties. Hoping for Piyush Goyal as Finance Minister Congress gained at the expense of non-aligned forces. So, the *mahagathbandhan* was a massive failure. NDA has one seat less as compared to 2014. BJP won 303 seats this time. What was their tally in 2014? Was it 336 or 352 in 2014 ? I think Ayushman Bharat pushed a lot of votes in Tier-II and Tier-III cities towards BJP. Any opinions ? Only person who could have taken on Modi was probably Amarinder Singh. 

You want to use nationalism? Well, Amarinder served in the armed forces. 

You want use the Sikh killings? Amarinder is a sikh. 

You want to use Modi's experience? Well, Amarinder is a CM of a border state. 

But ofcourse, the Gandhis would rather keep power to themselves than do something good for the party. According to India Today - Axis:

&#x200B;

The most important issue for people when deciding who to vote for was 

&#x200B;

Unemployment (33%)

&#x200B;

National Security was at 9%. 

&#x200B;

I think this is should be a clear message to to INC that people just don't see Rahul Gandhi as a capable leader who can solve India's problems. [removed] BTW it looks like the NDA will finally get a majority in the Rajya Sabha by 2020.

Aside from overblown fears about Emergency and changing the Constitution, it'll enable them to pass long-stalled bills like the Land Acquisition Reforms and Triple Talaq Bill. If you consider politicians as entrepreneurs like I do , we can see that BJP is a party (organisation) of first generation entrepreneurs who got their big break (funding) during the Emergency or the Ram Mandir movement. 

While the opposition seems like a tepid slow organisation of third , fourth or in case of the congress, fifth generation entrepreneurs. This manifests in the energy levels we see in the two organisations. While one is all about hustling and getting things done (some of which may be wrong), the second is plagued with unnecessary overhead costs that have no marginal utility whatsoever. 

Either the promoters step back and let a professional handle the organisation or this will not end up well for them. Lastly , this is a new India. We do not dream about government jobs. We dream about startups. We dream about doing things (which may be wrong ). We sure as hell hate the status quo. So regional parties lost the most?

I've always felt we need more diversity in the Parliament, but it seems that thats not what the most of the country feels.

I think the politics of appealing to the weakest and the backward is over. Maybe we've really moved on from being a primarily poor country and moving towards being a middle income country. In which case politicians will need to change their tactics.


In this regard, Modi is the only one speaking to people's aspirations. Everyone else is still stuck at hand outs and government programs. I guess that isnt enough anymore. And its as if RG and all the other party heads have missed the memo.


TLDR: BijliSadakPani is not enough anymore Sambit Patra lost or Won. Can't trust the media these days. Riding the ""Me first"" wagon they have stopped verifying sources.

[https://i.imgur.com/OSIjkL3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/OSIjkL3.jpg)

Edit:

He Lost. Imagine instead of working on policies Sambit Patra shouting in Parliament ""Mandir Yahi Banega"" [removed] Modi won election massively not just because of his work and performance but also because of the failure of Congress and especially Rahul Gandhi .hopefully they stop blaming the EVM and find out the real reason behind their biggest defeat and serve the country. This might be the time for BJP to start delivering their worth. The nation has shown trust, and its not something complicated that is needed, although it is hard. 

This election also shows a massive gap in the absence of a reasonable 3rd front. I hope the next election gives us some semblance of it at a national level, that people who connect can hopefully get behind. For eg, TN has no clue what they're doing. It all points to the fact that we don't have a good 3rd alternative. 

Democracy wins only when there is a ruling party and a non-senile opposition party working towards development with a north-star focus. Approach might be different, but things will be thought through. 

I'm not discounting what BJP is capable of doing, but their momentum is very high now. An influential opposition will ensure they don't derail. We can't say the same now. Rahul must resign Any ideas on how many for NOTA? AAP who? ...I’d say with finality that this is the end of “Muslim appeasement” in India.

If those of you that maybe have a better clue than myself could please chime in on what this means for Islamic populations in India and whether there would be a more dramatic mass emigration of these populations to more Islam-friendly countries? If Congress lets go of Gandhi family and allows deserving people to take control of it and revive it, I could see them becoming as a formidable competitor to BJP. Their progressive ideas against BJP's conservatism could resonate well with the youths of this nation. 

To those claiming that Congress would splinter into dozens of pieces, I highly doubt. There would be hiccups initially and perhaps for a decade. But once the stabilisation has returned , they could be our democrats! What I disliked the most was the opposition leaders claiming voter fraud when exit polls showed things look grim for them. Just be gracious and don't let the efforts of EC, the security forces and thousands of people who worked to keep this election free and fair be clouded like this. Our EC gives training and seminars around the world to newer democracies on how to conduct elections. They must be doing something right The bad thing in all this is the opposition does not know how to oppose. Congress, Tmc,Sp-Bsp are people who have been in power for quite a while.(That is also a problem with modi). But the difference here is we see is the process in which was able to acquire such leadership is through hardwork. Do not get me wrong,the guy is shrewd and conniving and will do anything to crush. The unique factor is that he knows it is not his job to crush. It is ours. We have the ability to take power out. He knows that and now it is proven that having money and connections dont matter. Other parties lost because of one thing,they continuously forgot about our power. BJP has fault in many way and right now in my opinion the majority voted for BJP is because of modi and his potential. The way the centre has been working now is astounding. Due to the 2014 election I wished to become an ias officer. 
And one more thing you should understand. People are not stupid anymore. Lok sabha is a different beast and assembly is a different beast. I live in Maharashtra and I a way I can imagine Maharashtrans not voting for BJP. What people are scared about now is the uncertainty. BJP knew they will win but not by this margin. This chat reminded me why I came on reddit. To stay away from Indian keyboard warriors. Thanks for reminding me :) Fucking delhi people. Atishi worked so hard for them and they voted for some cricketer(50%+). I dont care if this wasn't state election. 

I hope AAP loses in next election and they shut down AAP. These people don't deserve true politicians. Its not worth fighting for such people at all. Let them have actors and cricketers. How is NDA -1 I thought they did better than before? The land of self-respect movement, Tamil Nadu, sends two Ambedkarites, four communists (one of whom is a Sahitya Academy award winning writer), and three women writers to the parliament. Left politics should have been almost decimated with just one member in the parliament, but Stalin saves Marx in TN and sends four communists to the parliament. Can anyone give an insight into why TDP lost in Andhra Pradesh? [This](https://imgur.com/a/TugSAjS) is the Official Assembly wise result tabulation for Moradabad Lok Sabha Constituency. NRC had a significant role in propelling NDA in Assam. Opinions ? Would've been good for the nation if Congress didn't lose by such a large margin. I was expecting a 40% majority votes for Congress and 60% for BJP. This crushing defeat is bad. A party shouldn't have this much power. It'll only raise their arrogance to the peaks. That little fear of 'people might not vote for me next time if I don't try to do be a good leader' is what kept them in check. I think congress is dead. Like this year they hunt people to stand for Election and next election there will br free seat to contest under their party banner. Really what break trust at exterme level rather than courrption for an    Indian people Just want to ask a question. Modi took advantage of polarization. That's definitely one of the major reasons behind his landslide victory ( apart from presence of an worthy opponent etc). But polarization means presence of at least two poles. Who created these poles? Modi? Or were these poles always present in the common mind and Modi just added fuel to it? If it was present before, who actually created this pole? And accepted Hindutva is one of these poles, but from where the other pole is coming? As far as I know, Modi is promoting (or taking advantage of) the Hindutva pole, but from where this other pole is getting formed (or has already formed)? I can't speak for everyone in TN but the folks i know in my area of TN (Trichy) voted against BJP because of increase in communal tensions and demonetization, all the BJP supporters i know in TN are upper class brahmins This election is a watershed moment in Indian history. Welcome to the New India™. Just to put this into perspective, this win makes Modi a democratically elected leader voted in by almost a half a billion people; a genuine and credible mandate. Let that sink in for the moment. Just from the backing perspective, he is bigger than Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Akbar, Prithviraj Chauhan or any other historical figure in Indian history. India has not seen such a leader.

For good or bad, India is going to change dramatically over the next few decades. It will be a far cry from the India that we grew up in, part Socialist part Capitalistic, looking for an identity, a place in the world. Our children will grow up in a completely different India which is for all intents and purposes already a Hindu Rashtra. No constitution change is needed. As Modi pointed it out in his speech yesterday, secularism is now a dirty word and no politician can use (or abuse) it anymore.  

Bit by bit, Modi will consolidate power, just as Xi, Putin, Ergodan and all other authoritarians before him. With no credible opposition, he will do everything to keep himself in power, including destroying the very institution which brought him into power, the RSS. Although I do believe Modi has the right interests at heart and wants the best for India, he's a politician and self-preservation is going to trump national interest in the end. A credible opposition will eventually emerge and will most probably be from within the Sangh Pariwar itself. 

I personally am looking forward to this New India. I think it's going to be exciting. I expect a lot of changes, both good and bad in equal measure which I'm fine with. Just for keepsakes, I have saved today's newspaper. Whichever side of history Modi ends up in, we will look back to this day and recount it to our children and grandchildren.  [removed] Hope opposition asks good questions in parliament. Unchecked power is dangerous! Now that I have had some time to ponder on the result, I think that this government will not drastically change our country even with the majority seats. This will be more or less similar to other 2nd term governments. 

India will not really transform as much as we think it should under Modi's reign. The development will continue in the same rate, the system will be cleansed but in a glacial pace, the saffronisation will also be done relatively slowly. 

India will become a strong country with global importance in the future but it will never become a superpower. Indian people will have more money to spend but we will not be a rich country. 

Modi was right in his speech in a way, there will be no poor people in the country because they will be extinguished. Only a large middle class and a substantial upper class will remain. Because this was a mandate by the money, for the money, of the money.

All in all, India will become a bit more right-leaning country than before but it will still remain India. I will still be spat upon, riding my cycle, from a passing by vehicle. Some of us will be a uncomfortable at first but we will learn to adjust over the years. After all, we are Indians. Personally, I don't think it was a good idea to give so much power to a person like Modi.

But I guess, a significant percent of my countrymen disagree with me..... and I respect their decision.

Lets hope power does not ""corrupt"" him. Wonder why Nota never won smh Congress should abandon their type Communist advisors from JN uni  and socialists and be bold in their economic ideas. Manmohan Singh had good ideas but he was hobbled by the socialists in NAC Can someone find out the data on how many women and non-Hindu candidates were elected as MPs? Or is there a list, official or unofficial, of the winning candidates? Kerala and TN mi amigos! Quick question from an Indian American. How did IUML win the Ramanathapuram election in Tamil Nadu? The district is 70%+ Hindu, so I was surprised to see a pro-Muslim interests party win? Was there just really low turnout for Hindu's, or was there another reason? [deleted] As a South Indian I am concerned about both the polar ends of the political spectrum.

The separatist dravidian movement is reflexively projecting the BJP as a Northern invader. 

The BJP's ham-handed approach has really alienated large sections of these states that are extremely concerned about their linguistic and regional identity. 

Both sides need to moderate their stands. [deleted] [removed] The NDA got 352 in the last election I am waiting for the Pulwama conspiracy theories This sub is swarming with the pro-modi supporters since the election. So many posts are downvoted to oblivion if it is anti-bjp or talking about anything related to the muslims.  Probably my own post is gonna be heavily downvoted because it is related.

&#x200B;

The recent elections are going to make the minorities feel nervous about their future. They might not get killed by the gau rakshaks on the open but they can face more open or subtle discrimination on areas like housing,jobs,education and even government services since the racist supporters are getting a validation this time. It already happened in modi's gujrat, the same can happen in the entire north. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/minorities-made-to-live-in-fear-we-must-end-this-pm-to-party/articleshow/69500818.cms Am a Tamil guy who spent first 18 years of his life in Delhi and now 8 years and counting in Chennai. Was never really a guy who would take a side when everyone around me would fight about north India vs South India. Always thought all are equal Indians and this is just a silly childish fight. 
And Delhi being the home where I spent my teenage and adolescence, one day I do wanted to come back and live there. But after seeing the overwhelming majority of such an organisation (don't wanna go into what is wrong with them, save it) yesterday, I am done with the people of North. 2014 was understandable, people wanted change. But after all that happened in 5 years, why would such a majority want them back. I wouldn't be able to live with that mentality. Perhaps TN is the right place.

<Just needed a place to rant. I don't have any political inclinations to any other party as well. All are useless. But the ruling one is worse in more than one humanitarian grounds> can anyone tell when will elections happen on Vellore seat You can't fight a cult of personality with ideas and rhetoric. 

Godi media TV channels successfully brainwashed the electorate that Modi is Mhysa, a savior who ""sacrificed"" everything for ""Bharat Mata"", a ""strong"" leader, a person who works ""18 hours a day"" serving the nation. The ""300 killed in balakot"" bullshit was flashed non stop and was swallowed by the people. Ask anyone and they won't say they voted for BJP, they would say they voted for Modi. They might not even know who their local candidate was.

All the justifications we give like - maybe Jan dhan worked, maybe Ayushman worked - are hollow. Nobody cared about these schemes. BJP had the weakest, emptiest manifesto and no messaging on real issues. People voted for the superhero named Modi. A fictional character carefully crafted with a backstory, unrealistic achievements in his childhood and youth and reinforced with ""a day in the life of"" narratives with questions like mango eating and wallet keeping.

Modi occupies the same space in the psyche of the electorate which a godman or a ""chamatkari baba"" does. 

The southern states patting their backs for not voting for this charlatan shouldn't forget how they too have similarly worshipped leaders like MGR & Jayalalithaa in the past. Modi image building was from the same playbook in fact, creating a larger than life persona. Education has nothing to do with this. This is solely a lack of critical thinking and failure to question the narrative set by the mainstream media which comes from the ""accept what you're told"" mindset Indians are brought up with. The World Leader.......@ModiJi Yogendra Yadav fears that Bengal would become a battlefield for 2021 elections given the results in Lok Sabha.

It looks quite funny when Modi talked of inclusivity yesterday when his entire campaign lacked all those things. His twists and turns are lapped up quite easily and everything he said is forgotten conveniently.

The perpetual campaign machine while has reaped benefits for the party will probably leave our nation in a bad shape. BJP reminds me of the left in bengal. I can see it ruling on hate and this right wing vibe till economic numbers catch up and they fail altogether. If they really had some solution, they would have done something useful and not shitty demonetisation. But all that is fluff. We will see raw wisdom again. We will bitch again. They will use ram mandir and pakistan again in 2023. We will forget kathua and vote back again in 2024. This will continue, till the day, it actually won't. And that day, will be very bad. The sangh, just like CPIM will become a non existent entity, an entity whose ideas would be trashed. Unemployment has reached record numbers at a time when demographic dividend has peaked. It's a sorry state. The right wingers are fapping hire and fire as a solution. But that isn't even close to a solution. Electoral bonds, fudging gdp numbers, the list goes on and on

Every idea has its time. We had record low petrol prices. The BJP govt was a failure. And it will be a failure again. But it will win again. Mark my words. 

Amit shah is the mourinho of that bjp team. He can bring those results by tactics. But even moruinho couldn't save chelsea and manu what the fuck happened to AAP? I mean seriously voting gambhir over atishi, what kind of sickness is prevailing in Delhi? All this time I had heard that AAP had done great work in Delhi, reduced pricing for water, electricity, single window clearances, great school and everything but at the end of the day people still voted for BJP in Delhi instead of AAP.    
 I just can't get my around this fact, I mean motherf***ing delhi, what the hell were you thinking. For a second, I say that Modi is great and has insane schemes launched, but what happened to decentralisation of politics and the very basic idea of democracy. Man, honestly whoever shit people may have voted in other parts of India thinking at least Modi is better, I seriously would like to say to anyone from Delhi, boyyo you had an option to vote for a good candidate and yet you didn't. Man i really can't describe the shitload I want to drop on anyone from Delhi who voted for BJP. Worse is the fact that AAP was 3rd in most of the seats not even a runner up candidate. [removed] One thing that has been very notable over last five years was division of India and it's people on the grounds of religion . And it's been too prominent to go unnoticed. [deleted] [removed] [deleted] [removed] I think a person should cast 2 votes, one which he favors other he doesn't favors. The other one will be considered negative votes, subtract from the total number of votes. A better system? [removed] My predictions for the BJp right now are this:

1) stuff every open or partially available position with supporters. Heads of movie boards, education, military.

2) eradicate and arrest congress leaders where possible.

It’s the best time to switch to the turkey model.

Edit: saying this without elaborating is unfair.

The BJP is regularly going to face the fact that it’s chief economic and governance people are not world class. This means aside from increasing G - government spending, reading R - interest rates, and making laws leaner, they have little options.

This forces them to pull from opinionated and vocal members of society, who are not bureaucrats or economists. They will instead pull from the crop of vocal MBA types with the nest saleable credentials to make lateral entries into the system.

This also means that their government has a natural challenge when it involves unusual economic events. 

This is a political risk when it comes to keeping the voters who voted for Modi’s clean and reformer image, and a risk when it comes to incumbency on the ground which can’t be overcome by identity based incentives.


The BJP knows this, and has to make plans accordingly.

This means a plan beyond modi- which they don’t have yet. 

This also means a plan of best make use of their advantage.

Since they think long term, and learn from the world - this means putting people in positions of patronage and influence who will still remain should there be a turn around in their fortunes. 

Earlier, they didn’t have to worry about this - however this election showed that it is not a congress mukt bharat, and that the anti BJP views are likely to grow stronger.

Either they remove the anti BJP views, which I doubt they care about, or they deal with it. 

This is how they will deal with it, and keep their long term prospects healthy. So, not a single muslim MP from BJP? How many were given tickets? Why was Socrates apprehensive of democracy (5 min):

But I never got the unwarranted hate towards RG. (and more so, towards Kejriwal.)

I get that Indian politics isn't a clean haven, but ridiculing someone's identity and making a joke out of everything related to that person, is taking to another level.

I applaud RG for not giving up and still facing the crowd and the camera, with such calmness.

And frankly, his recent interview with Ravish, made me realize he's wayyy better than Modi. At least, he's open to criticism and questions. honestly, whoever wins this election, Rahul Gandhi has become a commendable person in my eyes. dude got balls the size of domes to be shamed publicly to such an extent daily in an out, and still act as a statesman of high order. He can use deaths of his family and honestly get a lot of sympathy votes, but he knows that would be biggest disrespect to their lives, he may not be a great politician, but he is a great person imo. His steep learning curve and resilience are actually inspiring. The interview with Ravish Kumar he says "" Rahul Gandhi has to be eliminated, and I must channel the public's mandate "". That is a very deep and Zen/Upanishadic thought. All the humiliation against himself and his mother (calling her waitress euphemism for prostitute)  he took it in stride and really grew. His message is about inclusion and love. He readily admits his mistakes and is willing to learn. And his assertive nature is very evident in his interviews. If youth in this country are looking for a life lesson this is the guy. 

On the other hand we have the hate spewing Modi whose life message is when you mess up dont own up and instead keep distracting by criticising others. I want to ask bhakts if their children would keep blaming their failures on others would they not teach them to take responsibility? This character deficiency becomes a virtue on Modi. Strange times we live in. Not a Congress or BJP supporter (NACOBS - everyone use this acronym to save time 😋), but Modi would've gained so much sympathy by crying in his speeches if something similar had happened to him. I dont admire Rahul but I absolutely hate Narendra Modi.

He is a grade 1 dumbfuck They call him that because 90% of Indians love making fun of others in a very mean way. Primitive Homo Erectus culture is well and alive in India. They even make fun of IIT grad Kejri because he wears mufflers, coughs and doesn't wear suits or what not. I too lost my grandma when I was 15. She used to talk to me everyday. Still, after 3 years I still feel like she's been talking to me every evening over the phone. There might be about 99 things wrong with Rahul Gandhi but his Never Give Up attitude is worth noting. Tbh I found Priyanka Gandhi's speeches much more compelling. Same for Kejriwal. Character assasination is an old but effective trick. To people saying Modi would've used the shit out of this if it happened to him, It is also worth noting that Modi has never appealed to people due to his OBC status. I think he uses the chaiwala status because it creates a better story, that's it. > He went up and tried to become a leader that the country deserves. 

You lost me with this line. 

&#x200B;

Sad for him and Priyanka Vadra to go through the ~~deaths~~ assassinations of their grand mother and father at such young ages and yet come out as decent individuals, Politics aside, we're all humans in the end. In this election, RaGa is clearly the lesser of two evils. But let's not get carried away. He is a greatly privileged individual who got far more chances in life than any less privileged person would get after so many fallures. 

The Pappu moniker is a creation of the BJP media cell, and I'll be the first to admit that it is somewhat exaggerated. But let's not forget that RaGa helped them a lot because a lot of his quotes are ridiculous. Now if you're thinking that Modi is just as much of a gaffe machine, I agree. The Congress simply has been unable to sell this idea as effectively as the BJP has sold ""pappu"" though.

Sure, the man currently sitting in the PM chair is a national disgrace. But not jump on the RaGa sympathy train just because of that. I agree with you but if politics is giving a shoulder for somebody who have suffered a lot then it should be given. No one denies that he suffered a lot and is not a ""pappu"" etc. But instead vote him for his vision, etc.
Voting him this way we will do the same thing as when India did by giving Modi votes because he was a chaiwala once. Rahul Gandhi is nice humble dude but wants to maintain status quo. Never though of it in that way, thank you for bringing this up Lets cut the bullshit. He was and continues to be part of the corrupt status quo political class, that includes the ruling party. Like every other politician, he will say anything to get your vote. Fuck Congress . And Fuck BJP. 

The Gandhis are all about power. They use the surname to invoke positive feelings that people have of Mahatma Gandhi and talk down to us during every election . Not to mention, RG and Congress play identity politics to stay relevant all the time . He has no other choice.

He is Rajiv Gandhi's son so naturally he had to be forced by Sonia Gandhi and other Gandhi family loyalists to step up to the plate and take command as the leader of the party otherwise it will someone overambitious who will hijack the party and marginalize the remaining Gandhis from the party. I sympathize with RaGa. It is difficult to cope with a loved ones loss, let alone to a brutal murder. 

But this isn't something unique to him. There have been riots and terrorist attacks across various cities in India and the people there had to literally go back to the same places where other people or may be a relative lost life (spirit of Mumbai, lol). At least RG had alternative to go to UK and get away from this. But most of the country did not.

While it's pretty shameful what BJP is doing with ex-PMs long dead, I don't see a problem with people calling him pappu. That's criticism of his thoughts and actions and he is responsible for it. In 2014, RG made Modi look much better and this time it's the opposite. >At 14 years old he saw his beloved grandma get shredded with bullets by the man he used to play with. At 21 his father was blown up by terrorists. He didnt even get to see his father's body one last time. 

Neither of them were saints or innocent victims. Rahul's dad got blown up by the same terrorist group(LTTE) he and his mother(Indira) started funding and arming in Sri Lanka, starting a bloody civil war that went on for decades with over 1.5 lakh casualties.

Rahul's grandma was killed by her bodyguards as a result of the Sikh insurgency she herself fomented by propping up Bhindranwale and his separatists in Punjab as an alternative to the Akali Dal. It took another decade before the situation in Punjab was normalized. Not before tens of thousands of lives were ruined.

Not to say it wasn't harsh on Rahul... But the phrase 'hoist by your own petard' comes to mind.

>He went up and tried to become a leader that the country deserves.

Rahul didn't try to become a leader anyone deserved. Until his coronation last year he had spent over 15 years in politics refusing to take up any position of responsibility. He refused to be a CM or a member of MMS's cabinet. He refused to be PM candidate in 2009 and even in 2014 wasn't officially named as such. 

He's only taking up these roles now because Sonia is too old and has retired leaving his party with no other choices.

> And never used pity politics to gain votes. 

Did you even follow his 2014 campaign? He started it by giving speeches where he'd remember being angry when his grandma was killed(Which made everyone cringe because that immediately led to the 1984 riots which he refused to address). He'd complain about trivial things like how his mother scolded him or how Indira made him eat all the vegetables on his plate. He was the epitome of privilege.

And this time he hasn't hesitated to exploit even issues of national security for his gain. He and his party have repeatedly tried to attack the Supreme Court and CJI, going against the advice of senior lawyers in their own party. They've tried to cast doubt on the armed forces over the surgical strikes, airstrike and even Pulwama attack. He personally hounded and harassed Manohar Parrikar while the latter was dying of cancer. I am quite sure OP is aware of all this.


>So when people call him Pappu or make fun of his dad's death, it fills me up with rage because when you take out the political figure out of him, he is a person who suffered too much too early in his life. Something most of us will never or never did suffer in life. 

This is such a vacuous argument. This is the general election, not Big Boss. Nobody is voting for candidates for their sob stories, what people care about is what they are as politicians. Lots of netas no matter how vile their politics is are look like pleasant, charming, even charismatic figures when you meet them in person. I've also read interviews of some journalists who've closely followed Modi(I think Aakar Patel) who say he has a charming and witty personality and they get along with him personally but hate his politics. But nobody highlights or cares about that. Also, most of his ""stupid"" image comes from him not being able to speak Hindi that well I think and also because he used to be a nervous public speaker. He belongs to the most corrupt family in Indian History. Since Independence, we have seen generation after generation this family has orchestrated a mockery of Indian democracy. Somebody has become India's first prime minister despite not being the most popular one. Then came his daughter. Then came her son. Then came his wife. Then came her son. This son turned out to be not so effective, so came his sister. Where does it end? People now seem to be waiting for Priyanka's son to grow up so that he can ascent to the throne. We should be ashamed of ourselves for this servile mentality. This family has transformed the grand old party into a family affair. In which part of the world a party president's job remain secure after an election debacle like 2014? Everybody else in this world has to prove himself or herself in order to enjoy power -- it seems rules are different for Gandhi family.

When would we learn to teach our child that ""no matter what his/her family background is, he can be prime minister of India if he really deserves it"". The truth is we never deserved independence from British. Sycophancy is in our blood. Servitude is in our DNA. We always longed for a king -- a mighty king who is not a common man - so that our king can rule us and we can concentrate on our daily affairs. Democracy is not for us. Let us declare India to be a monarchy and put Rahul Gandhi in her throne -- this would satisfy a lot of people I guess. I feel ashamed to claim our country to be a Democratic one. If Rahul Gandhi wasn't Gandhi and just Rahul, Would we still troll him the way we do now? Just a genuine question! > He went up and tried to become a leader that the country deserves. And never used pity politics to gain votes.

BS. He is there because his title is *Gandhi*. He's even *using* his sister to win election. Fearing defeat his sister eventually run away. What a disgrace!! You have very little or no knowledge of Nehru-Gandhi family. Kindly don't promote this family members.

Congress has completely failed against Modi-AS duo gang. RG can't even talk cohesively for 30 mins about demonetization, or botched GST or current economic situation, unemployment, farmer issues, healthcare, education, international relation, etc. There are so many issues, but he can't talk with a alternative plan. Like Modi, most of his answers are scripted and they are boring. He himself out on bail.

Congress has no vision, other than its dynastic demands. If Congress has to survive they need to find out another PVNR or MMS. They need to reject Gandhi family and reinvent itself. I'm no fan of modi and I align with a lot of Congress' recent policies but come on..

>And never used pity politics to gain votes.

Really? I've seen him mention that story multiple times at many rallies when he's spinning off his *I'm all about love* message.

>when you take out the political figure out of him, he is a person who suffered too much too early in his life

This is called an *appeal to extreme fallacy*. Some one or two among a million, hit below the belt and make fun of his dad's assasination (making fun of his dad's dumb policies doesn't count). It happens in public life. You can't use those extreme examples to justify the opposite extreme, which is that he is now magically good and deserving of sympathy.

He's a rich tosh who had a tragedy. There's plenty of others with much worse tragedies who don't use those to gain sympathy like he does, so cry me a river. Just a couple of decades ago, people had to go to jail and face torture for having a different political belief.

People laugh at him because he wants the highest job in the country with no qualifications or management experience, without even visiting his constituency for years, and he doesn't even seem to want it himself. You can't just spin the story around and say that everyone laughing at him is now an asshole because his dad was assasinated. Those are two different things. >I dont support Congress, but lets not insult or let neech aadmi's insult and hurt those soft spots.

lol the irony of it. Sanjiv and Rajiv were responsible for the deaths of thousands of minorities. Rajiv sent the IPKF to meddle in Sri Lanka and got nothing to show for it. IPKF was accused of war crimes. It is best not to talk of Indira who though India was her jagir. I have no sympathy for Congress or Rahul for that matter but that doesn't mean I will support BJP. I have had two deaths in my family too... one can recover. Teenagers are more resilient than people think. My take away from that trauma was that if you give up at that stage, it will be your own fault, and no one will be able to help. See I have thought of this, but the issue with that notion is that he doesn't know how to talk or connect. You have such a huge connect via this story to the Indian population but you don't.

He is plain simple not smart enough to be a leader and lives off his name. I joke this with my friends in whatever way RaGa is perceived with his being bullied around, being sent to a foreign boarding school at a young age and his episode with his Dad and Grandma he can change the perception any day. And with that image, he can easily become the PM You do bring some good points.agreed . He deserves respect.

However, I am done with dynasty politics. We cannot afford to have the prime ministership passed on as a royal jewel. Look. So many political leaders faced such issues throughout their lives. So many have overcome their problems and we have to respect them. But consider the privilege Rahul Gandhi has. He has a very powerful family who will swoop down to make sure he leads a luxurious life. How many of our common people have that? His only qualification is that he is son, grandson of two PMs and he hopes to become the PM just because of his tragedies. There are other leaders who worked their ass off for their political careers. They deserve better. This is not the medieval age. Exactly, i truly despise modi and his party of goons and fear mongering buffoons, but at the same time, i see no future with RG becoming PM, dude has no credibility in regards to that, only if congress looked past their dynasty politics and made someone like shashi tharoor the PM candidate, I would vote for congress in a heartbeat. I think you are mixing a lot of things here. And I agree with you that today's politics has reached new low levels and all our politicians are indulging in is mudslinging ... and no constructive discussion is happening.

Now to my disagreement with you ... on his family being dragged into the political debate

1. His father is a former politician and that too a former Prime Minister - who has contributed positively and negatively to the country.
1. His grandmother is also a former politician and a former politician who oversaw one of the darkest periods of Indian Democratic history.
1. Congress and Rahul continue to ask people to vote for them using the Rajeev, Indra & Nehuru's names


Secondly - on people calling him Pappu

1. This is a guy who's parent, grandparent & great grandparent were Prime Ministers of India
1. By virtue of above points - this guy has had access to best education, and life that can be offered to an individual
1. This is a guy aspiring to become the Prime Minister of this country
1. He struggles to talk and convey an idea or thought while talking
1. He is unable to come up with Policy Points and defend himself

I have had a good education and work in a relatively good area. Considering that he was supposed to have a better life than me, I do have an expectation that he will be better than me in order to become the prime minister. So yes - I will make fun of him when he fails so miserably. Is it double standards? yes - cause I do not have such high expectation of Modi - considering that he is relatively uneducated chai wala and is a cattle goon. Fuck off True as a person I believe he went through a lot, but imo I just can't see him as a leader Congress should break away from silver spoon leadership and give others a chance pretty sure there are competent leaders inside Congress party way deserving than Rahul G ( now don't come at me with whataboutism regarding with Modi).
Everyone is like ""what about Modi then"" let's be clear even if you hate him he play politics well Rahul G don't it's simple as that.

Now coming back I think in coming year Priyanka can be a good leader but still I don't know if I can support silver spoon fed candidates over people like Arvind Or even Modi. I can only imagine the pain he went through. He is in politics and nothing is spared here.

I think he was thrown into politics too soon and his lack of experience in his initial days reflected in his speeches and handling of party work. Congress needs a strong leader at this time and I don't see Rahul becoming one anytime soon. If I am being honest I don't think he is really made for politics. I don't think much of his political activity (so far), but not one politician in India has been scrutinized (derogated, ridiculed and underestimated) as much as he has been. After all that, he is still around & making so-called 'master politicians' tetchy & annoyed is just great to watch. RG has the balls to come out in public and answer tough questions. Unlike somebody we know. There is a difference between personal life and ruling a country i also lost my dad when i was in class 6 that doesn't make me eligible to be so sort of leader that is my personal life. As a person Rahul Gandhi is strong and i respect him but when it comes to ruling a country the case is different. [deleted] It’s really cool for the OP to empathize with Rahul Gandhi IMHO. I never even though of his past and how strong one might have to be to move forward from that. 

That being said, I don’t like the “Pappu” comments not because I support him or think he has the mettle to take on any kind of a leadership role but rather because it does an absolute disservice to the democratic process in India. By calling him “Pappu”, we glaze over his incompetence and inexperience. Someone mentioned earlier that he never had to work for the position and I think that it’s really important for people drill that into their heads.

Basically the outcome of the political scenario is:
1. The only major, non-communal political party is being headed by someone who doesn’t seem to have any achievements of his own other than being born to the most powerful family in India’s history.
2. People still think that because his last name is Gandhi, he has some kind of a privilege to represent the nation. These days I honestly think that Modi is a more accurate representation of what our country is than anyone else. (I am absolutely disgusted by this thought, btw).
3. We either sympathize and excuse Rahul Gandhi or utterly humiliate him. We don’t set attainable goals for the opposition, nor do we converse about what needs to change with all the parties playing the field. It’s always bad vs incompetence.
4. Locking of leadership roles based on nepotistic/mythological values is what has deprived the country of countless leaders  who could have actually made a difference in their communities. This system has blocked individuals access to both resources and potential.


EDIT: accidentally hit submit That doesn't make him a good leader
#Daenerys Politics shouldn't be a family business. Full sympathy with Mr. Gandhi. But he has to learn about the country and countrymen a lot. He might have to learn to become a visionary from other great leaders either domestic or international. Their is learning curve involved he has to go through with it...15 years down the line...he will be a good one to qualify gor PM’s post. At the moment he should lead himself to be a great visionary. I am NOT congress supporter in any way though. Totally non-specific to Rahul Gandhi, but I heard he is running for MP from two different constituencies. If so...how/why is that legally possible? Pappu to Prabhakar. 

He’s actually made an effort this time. Kudos to him. No matter what ppl say Gandhi name is keeping congress party together. This is their only “glue”. Can you see the difference here. Prince Charles and Prince Harry lost their mother too. But their country poured lots of love to them. > close loved ones?

Who are already in short supply for people in his position.

Us nobodies can turn to a lot more people in our circle, relatively. Seriously thats what i was thinking, Rahul ji made lots of sacrifices in his life time and lost his family members in the process, but still look at him! His love for our country is astonishing. After all the tragedies he still want to serve his country. what a legend,he is truly our inspiration. Dhanya ho vo Maata jisne iss saput ko janam diya. [removed] I never hated him but thank you for making me realise this hard part of his life that most of us have forgotten. [removed] And this is something i dont know how the fucking hell nobody understands. But india is ready to insert logic in modi's radar statement.
EDIT: I can see some very great scientists and engineers of our country are getting really offended here.  As inspector Gordon would say :
“It’s because Rahul is the Prime minister India needs, but not the one it deserves. So we’ll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he is a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A dark knight!”

If you actually think of it Rahul and Bruce Wayne share a similar character Arc. Both of them lost loved ones, are rich, compassionate and fight goons who want to destroy their respective worlds after all. Also if there roles were changed between modi and Rahul, i’m pretty sure there wont be a day without modi saying my dad and grandmother sacrificed their life for the country, vote for me. Irrespective of how bad your dad is, this is a horrible thing to happen to any kid while growing up, i respect Rahul for that, Modi would have made a hashtag out of it by now and gained sentimental votes > I dont support Congress 

No harm in supporting congress this time. Enough with BJP's ***~~change~~*** [removed] I really appreciate your post. I thought same things but when I shared it with my friends they showed me a video where RG says about potato machine. But one should never forget he never used his father's death as a tool in politics, no matter how inexperienced he is. People who has lost parent would understand this. It's pretty clear for me - if somebody would have asked me who would you hang out with? Rahul, hands down.

Modi is the uncle who just comes into a party and looks around while everybody gets creeped out and stay silent till he leaves. [removed] [removed] Never thought about this. Thank you for pointing it out! Well said. Here, take your gold. [removed] Bro watch akame ga kill He went up and tried to become the leader that the country deserves.
I don't support Congress. 
Dude, really ? maybe he has gone insane but we dont know about it formally Might be off topic but I think Rahul Gandhi is similar to Daenerys Targaryen. Both have powerful fathers who had been at the helm of power. Now both of them are trying to find their place in politics that their family have left them. Both of them not exactly suitable to lead but trying hard to make people believe that they can.

Deaths are never good. People always get hurt for life and some take a lifetime to recover from the loss of a loved one. But grotesque deaths of not one but TWO close loved ones? I am surprised Rahul didnt go insane from the shock or become a drug/alcohol addict.

Your language is forever enshrined as the language of our national anthem; yours is the only Nobel laureate in literature in India - not Hindi not Tamizh nor even Sanskrit. Bangla - not Bengali by the way - was one of the first languages out of modern indo aryan languages to wake up. And bengal being the place of origin for both left and right wing icons it has a special place in indian politics.

Believe me Didi I am trying, it's just not that easy. :(

EDIT: For those who didn't get the joke - I've been trying to learn Bengali for a while now and it's been pretty fucking hard reading just wiki pages, since good grammar books are not available outside of India. 

So chill the fuck out folks, it was a fucking joke. God... She will make it an outsider Vs Bengali in the next election. Kya chutiyagiri hai. Chalo paani khaake aata mein🤣 I just know,

*aamhi tomharo bhalo wasi*

and

*rosogolla* Imagine every other state did the same.
We would all learn so much I am not in favour of this vague but if Mamata is truly for asserting Bengali pride then she has to make it mandatory for all CBSE schools in the state to teach Bengali as a mandatory subject. In particular KV have a mandatory subject of Sanskrit ? Mamta has to mandate Bengal in all schools including CBSE/KV and ICSE.

One may say it’s already mandatory but IMO not an optional but as a complete subject and contribute to overall grading. Gladly choose bengali over hindi for me. Hindi is not our national language. southerners will become second class citizens if hindi is imposed. I am sure the whole thing looks like a well planned strategy for WB Assembly Elections.... BJP has already started their Game plan for WB. Next Social media campaigns will start soon to demonize Mamta...

531,Politics,"he (it is pretty clear that people are voting for him rather than their local candidate) is getting more than 50% of the votes in a lot of areas. that alone is kind of amazing. would be interesting to see the final vote share. it was around 32% last year iirc. It is really significant for Rahul Gandhi, even more so actually.

Easily the worst opposition leader this country has seen. If this doesn't get him to step out of politics then I don't know what will. Before you start bitching without reading the actual article, the last sentence in the article should boil down the main point for you.

>Modi has been able to neutralise the decades-old social engineering formula of caste-based parties. And this change may be here to stay.

Whatever his government might do for the country in the next 5 years, he has indeed destroyed the caste based voting that has plagued India for must of its post independence existence.

Hopefully no more ""I voted for him because we're of the same cast"" bullshit. The most liked person won.. democracy 101 I am so sad :( but congratulations to modi and his supporters. India's people have spoken clearly, loudly and across regions, castes and classes. They want Modi, and no one will do. As a person who believes in democracy, I respect this mandate of the people, even though I personally do not agree with it.

Personally, I think Modi's appeal and Amit Shah's strategy work like magic on India's people. I also feel that Modi and Shah will rule India for another 10-20 years.

There is probably some ground reality truth that is not being reported amidst all the right and left wing media reports. I don't know. But however different my own social, economic and political opinions are, I cannot disagree with facts. That's just basic science. India is now Modi's country.

May the Almighty grant Modiji health, peace of mind and a genuine sense of security and the wisdom to see that this time, again, he has got a chance to actually do good long-term beneficial things for India and for Indians.

Gujarat already has a massive solar park. The Modi Govt has already done one tree-plantation drive. Climate change and water shortage do not discriminate based on how you voted or who you support. Hence, it is important for all of us to realise that we will be forced to work together to prevent a dystopia, to prevent riots and to prevent Army rule and revolution. 

It is here that Modiji can actually make a change. Once again, he finds that he has the luxury of a simple majority. Destiny does not give such chances to many people, especially in a democracy. If he really wants to be the Nehru of this century, he can do that in the next 5 years by focussing on climate change and the environment.

He could ban plastic, he could mandate glass and metal containers for liquid foods, he could give a massive boom to the refrigeration and food storage industry by making a dozen cold storage warehouses in each constituency and in one fell swoop, he can remove the decades-old distress of the farmers by removing control of the middlemen. 

He could make a new ministry for Nitin Gadkari - Electric Transport Minister - and order him to layout plans for electrification of Indian railways - something that is already in starting stages.

He could rebrand MNREGA and start a ""Harit Bharat"" campaign like the Swachch Bharat campaign and get people to plant trees and forests. In the Sangh, he has a massive civilian army of completely dedicated, able-bodied men who will dutifully follow all of his orders in letter and spirit. Trees and forests are not political. But rain, water and crop failure can become political. Even strategically speaking, any leader who ensures water supply to rural India will be rewarded amply with votes and devotion.

The important thing is for him to realise that he has been given the rare second chance by destiny to become a great man and go down in history as a nation-builder.

I hope he will see this opportunity. I wish him the very best in nation-building.

It was a very enlightening election and in the coming days everyone will have a lot to learn and possibly to adapt. I think it's time for me to go back to science and technology and leave the politics to the truly passionate. I don't have the stomach for it.

Wishing Modiji all the best.

BMKJ, VM.

PS: This is my last post. I won't be replying. No hard feelings. India gets what india deserves. This is clearly rejection of creation of fake propaganda, caste politics and fear psychosis. I have never voted. I was in hostel for Vajpayee's election and have lived out of the country since the late 90s. 

When the country was prospering under Vajpayee, it was a shock to me to see him lose, but it was understandable to some extent. A lot of people felt left out of India shining. Then you had a lost decade under the Congress. 

This time I was apprehensive that Indians would make the same mistake. I am glad they did not. Isn't it too early to write off caste politics when we get dalits getting attacked for no reason regularly? Modi may have unified but caste still runs in this country. It's like celebrating a winning a race with only 2 people when one is handicapped n is this Jio effect? Any social scientist here? Why? He won't do jack shit.

532,Politics,"Good for him(and his party). Why Gandhis don't run for CM candidate ?

Become CM of UP, Delhi ... show some good work and then congress should project them as PM candidate ?

The biggest mistake RaGa did was, not taking any significant responsibility in MMS government, by doing some good work in a ministry it would've been much easier for congress to project them as PM candidates. I believe the Congress is stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

One one hand, Rahul Gandhi should resign and hand over the leadership (given the abject performance 2 elections in a row). 

On the other hand, there are no viable leaders in the party with a national presence (or even a regional presence). Thus, Rahul’s resignation may lead to power struggles or very weak leadership which can cause the party to split and disintegrate. And if this happens, there will be no national level party left to challenge the BJP (for multiple election cycles to come, given that it takes a long time to get a party established at a national level; and with the BJP controlling the media, it will be nearly impossible for a new, or even existing, party to make itself known and heard). This helps the BJP much more than if Rahul stays on.


Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. I only hope they elect someone competent and not rush to the sibling. What the INC should do is learn from other democracies. In the UK for instance they have elections with candidates which the party members vote on. 

Let the INC come up with a few candidates who share their vision for the party, let members vote on them. And not FPTP, use a better system like IRV so you get a leader that most of the party actually wants. 

At this point, the CWC saying they're open to radical changes but not to letting RaGa go is ludicrous. You can't demand accountability and responsibility from your state level leaders if you don't demand it from your national leadership. Sachin Pilot should replace him. I think, in the long run, this will help Rahul Gandhi's political career. He should just quit his party posts and tour the entire country for the next five years or so, and then make a comeback. He should take notes from Jagan Reddy. I do not have any hope left, INC is at a stage which Apple was after their failure with the Newton, the INC is going to require a fucking miracle to get them out of this fucking ridiculous situation they dug themselves in. Shashi Tharoor? Good for him and congress Good. Who are the viable alternatives? Honestly, I sometimes feel sorry for him. I remember in the late 90's he was called as the most eligible bachelor of India. Here was this super rich kid, smart looking. Could have lived a flamboyant life, doing whatever the heck he wanted. But suddenly he is stuck in something he is not good at. Has to attend boring speeches, wear boring clothes. Don't know if he really likes being the leader. And finally the most eligible bachelor didn't even get to marry!
Good for him if he resigns and enjoys life. It’s good if he steps aside. I mean he tried his best and still couldn’t do much of an improvement in the polls. I hope they really think out of the box and get someone credible. This is really bad news for BJP Pretty sure replacement will be Mallikarjun Kharge. Its going to be Priyanka or soniya again. Respect. Does anyone think that he wanted out all along but there was too much pressure and this is the perfect reason to now finally do it?

He's always been extremely reluctant to be a politician Capt. Amrinder Singh? If he stepped down, really it'll be a very good for Congress and India Bhakts needs to find new ways to assassinate the character of new leader. They're trying to stall this as much as they can. They're using emotional blackmail, hoping he'll calm down after a while, suggesting he appoint a 'Working President' so that he can remain leader in name at least, and trying to get Priyanka as a backup. They've also delayed choosing someone to head the Congress MPs in the Lok Sabha, maybe so they can give him that post as an alternative.

This is quite unprecedented in Congress history. I've finally developed some respect for him.

My advice to Rahul: Leave all the chamchas behind and go on a padyatra from Kashmir to Kanyakumari to interact with ordinary voters and see what they really want. Then decide if you want to take back the reins or not. He should relegate himself to some smaller role, stay there for a while and then work his way up. For example he can spearhead legislative elections of any state and project himself as the CM candidate, lead his party to victory, become an excellent CM and take that state to new heights, then he can project himself as a worthy PM candidate.

He can learn a thing or two from the rise of his opponent Narendra Modi, Gujaratis adore him and he came to national scene due to his success in Gujarat. Manmohan Singh? Sachin Pilot and Mallikarjun Kharge? Just him stepping down will not solve the problem. Congress really needs to put forward some of their on ground workers. This is the only way people will get behind them and challenge Modi Shouldn't quit and shouldn't blame himself.

A few tips from my side:

1) It'd be really awesome if you had a subreddit, cuz Facebook can become really Obnoxious, what with all the meme pages, and all the hundreds of friends that people can have. Atleast with a subreddit, Moderation is much more strict, there's pinned posting allowed, and well, there's a lot more control in general.

2) Are there plans to set up a fort location, i:e One location/constituency, that you'd prefer to start with, and focus on first? Cuz I think if you'd start with one, you might slowly reach state-level, which is more than enough to get the nation's attention. I like your long term approach. Anything is possible with tenacity and will power. Good luck to you. The trouble with your plan is that it will strike the vast majority of Indians as being culturally inauthentic. The idea as presented simply is not Indian. It is just an artificial and weird mish-mash of a lot of things that seem to look good at this stage in history (2019), but it doesn't have deep roots in the soul and soil of the land.

BJP is successful because they have a vision for India that (as per their narrative) is as ancient as our earliest recollections of India itself. This vision is made of songs and stories and Gods and saints that are deeply embedded in a lot of Indians' consciousness and their understanding of who we are. They can cite ancient scriptures as sources of the values they advocate. Their imagery and rhetoric have deep roots in the nation's history. Take the icon of mother India or Bharat Mata. Some say that this idea is just a copy of the corresponding European ideas, but every Hindu sees Bharat Mata as just another instance of Shakti, the mother goddess, which is an idea that has deep roots in the Hindu psyche nourished by a vast fund of religious literature and practices.

>	Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition

What RSS achieved over 50 years is only possible if you believe strongly in one ideology. Religion and their rules are a tool to make people cooperate on a large scale, without which they will not. 

I feel it's impossible to create organized movements in that kind of way anymore, unless you use a strong ideology to unite people. But if you do that, it will create blind faith and extremism and that will be counter your original purpose. Moreover, it will counter act against one of the most important qualities that people need in India - Individualism. 

Look at the best countries across the world, they don't have any popular organized groups throughout the country. The Vegan community is the closest comparision I can think of in those countries and even vegans are famous for being intolerant, adhering to their strictly enforced guidelines within the community. As soon as you place the identitiy of a community or a group above an individual, it will lead to the same result. The devloped countries and their institutions are succesful because the majority doesnt beleive in any single ideology strongly, all of them value individual thoughts so it becomes impossible to compromise everything, all at once. 

Therefore, I don't think you should try to replicate their success. But I also don't know a solution to how it can be possible to impart these important values without making under a banner. I really like this idea, and to be honest I was thinking of something like this myself. I'd really like to join, or at the very least contribute to discussions and present ideas and solutions.
 In addition, somebody mentioned here that the ideology might not appeal to Indians the same way that hindutva does and I believe their statement holds a lot of truth. AAP is an example, so it should be a priority to figure out how to strongly appeal to the masses. 

Overall, I want to thank you for being the change you want to see and for actually doing something lol. Please make a sub, not everyone of us are in FB. Police Reforms are the key to unlock the India's potential, How else do you think we can bring fear in the minds of criminals in India? If this takes off, it'd be great!  
I look forward to casting my vote for the IhP one day!

My only concern is, I don't think your message and philosophy will resonate with the same electorate that voted 'Hindutva Eva Jayate' into power. What's your views on North south cultural divide, LGBT rights? And I'd like to repeat a question someone else had raised is there any place you'd begin, a movement starts only if you begin and progress continually. Indians: Neva! > But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. 



This statement is similar to that of Holocaust deniers. Caste system and discrimination are sins of ancestors, you can't say Muslim are responsible, or reservation cemented caste identities.


I would like to see study or source which says caste identities were less fixed before implementation of reservation in 1947. I repeat, your statement is similar to telling Jewish people that Nazis were not responsible for Holocaust. You can't whitewash thousand year history.






> This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.


Mandal politics came as reply to kamandal politics. Dalits voted Lalu yadav because ranveer Sena did yadav/dalit massacres. Check the links between murli manohar Joshi and ranveer Sena.



Poverty in backward castes was reduced from 1991. Incidentally that was the time when caste based identity politics started. Your claims that identity politics has hurt dalits won't be accepted by even forward castes.










> Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world.

250 million dalits are richer than ST and Muslims. Check facts.

> We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. 

Lol. I can't even. 

> When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. 


It's not about education, it's about ""equal opportunity"". You stop discrimination and it's enough for dalit progress.

> This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system.

How can you give justice to 70% SC,ST,OBC when there is zero judge in supreme Court from these castes? What about 90% supreme Court judges being brahmins?



> We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community 

Are you quoting Sumitra mahajan and her chocolate and kids comment about dalits?

> on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.


But there is persuasive evidence for that. 

> Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.







Your assumption that SC,ST wont vote for you if you said anything against reservation is absurd. You have freedom of expression which dalits respect. BJP is against reservation. In Bengal and Karnataka there are 24% dalits per state. Whole BJP victory in WB, Karnataka, Orissa was possible because of dalits. More dalits voted for NDA than UPA.



You should have taken advice from some social science professor before writing this. It'd be really helpful if you added in links in your post. 

Also, kudos to taking the effort to trying to make a change. Atleast, you haven't given up like me ✌️ How naive to assume that the social, economic, and political inequality is not due to caste and just by providing jobs every issue will be solved. This is the problem of this sort of liberal, we all are equal, agenda, it presumes that opportunities are equally available for all. Whereas it overlook the fact that how Dalits and Adivasis are still discriminated and killed for even attaining some kind of social mobility. props to people who read the entire thing👏

But I hope you progress swiftly. Humanist? Yeh kaun jaat hai? What is your take on illegal immigration from Bangladesh ? Maybe a TL;DR at the beginning to give readers a vague idea about what's followed. What's your take on Christian missionaries and Islamic extremism? Our philosophy is to leave the existing reservation system untouched - you lost me on that one. 

If the reservation systen has not changed anything in 70 years, why should it stay on?

Why should we have a system where merit is not the primary criteria and group after ethnic group agitates to name themselves as backward - Jats and Marathas? Not calling yourself an atheist organisation is fine and dandy because we know how scary that word is to the uneducated, but trying to exclude ""secular"" doesnt make sense. Most of the policies your organisation supposedly stands for I can get behind, so I still want to see where this goes. Good luck. If you mean Hindutva as a religion, then definitely yes. But Hindutva as our culture/race can't be removed from us. Because that is what we are. Everyone can practice any religion or adopt a newer one, but the race is not a matter of choice. BJP is totally losing it by mixing Hindutva as a religion and Hindutva/Bharatiya as a race. If you are against affirmative action and reservation then that is terrible. Shows that you have put zero thought into your policies and are just rambling. This is not going anywhere. Atrocities against dalits are increasing and your solution is to take away the one helpful ladder they have? Won't lie, I am from right wing but I'll defect if you abolish reservation. You have my vote. Are you have an AMA . Fat Chance. You will not come to power even in 1000 years as your ideas needs people with good reasoning skills - asking questions was never encouraged in India. Yawn ! 😪 I consider myself humanist. I see few fundamental issues which I figured through lot of introspection. These seem straightforward but no one follows these:

i) Do not give freedom of speech to a group/person who campaigns to demolish freedom of speech

ii) Do not give freedom of religion to group/person who campaigns to demolish freedom of religion

iii) Do not give property rights to group/person who campaigns to abolish property rights 

iv) Do not give human rights to persons who work against human rights.

and so on.

Criticism welcome. This naturally eliminates commies, jihadis, anti fos activists, criminals etc. and yet is 'humanist' in nature.

**Manifesto**

&#x200B;

There are problems in the way we govern our country today and the political parties of today are too entrenched in their histories (dynasties, Hindutva, regionalism, casteism, communism, crony capitalism, et cetera) to be able to find the solutions India needs to move forward.

Indian humanist Party (IhP) is a facebook page for finding those solutions. We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.

The principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.

**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.

We believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:

1. The primacy of fundamental human rights
2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.

**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**

This is a 50-year project.

The RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country’s politics.

Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.

**Metrics driven**

We will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:

1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)
2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)
3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)
4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)
5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)
6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)
7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)
8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)
9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)
10. Gender equality report (87/144)

We will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.

**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**

Capitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.

**We are committed to internal democracy**

As a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.

**National security**

We will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don’t believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.

**Caste and reservations**

We absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don’t apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.

Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.

Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.

**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**

We believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.

Individuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.

**Science and business**

We will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We’re fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.

We need politicians like her, but politicians like her will not survive the Indian political system. American politics is dirty, but nothing compared to Indian politics. She is #BlueTrump, and coincidentally might be the next president after trump too. If you are conservative and you underestimate her, you're going to be conservative version of 2016's left.

Because she won’t be she will be called a whore or something of that euphemism. 2) She is going to be mercilessly called names for being a female 3) She has morals. Big no no in Indian politics India has multiple politicians like her. There's multiple social democratic parties in India. We saw politicians like her emerge in this election like Atishi. The conservative right wing majority ensured that such politicians will not come up in India.

If you'll force yourself to know about something just to make conversation trust me it won't work. Media right now in this country is either paid for by one side or the other. We are in a dire need of a neutral channel/source. 

I would suggest you try to balance yourself with opinions from all side. I would suggest you to look for sources from both sides of the coin. Do not place yourself in the source which suits your view of the world most. It would result in a echo-chamber.

Also, don't close yourself to the only English sources. 88% of the country is not English speaking. I would suggest to check sources of local languages as well.

I disagree with the subreddit of /r/India at many points but I still engage in this subreddit in a polite manner. /r/India is a good source for news. Like /u/igivequalityhugs, I would suggest for you to research issues which are interesting to you.

> I feel that if there was a detailed discussion about these topics, I wouldn't be able to contribute much to the conversation and I'd like to change that.

If you don't know anything about the issue, try to listen to what others are saying. It may not be true but it will definitely give you a starting point. These are meant to only be suggestions, and heavily biased ones, but:

**Do:**

* Pick a (good) newspaper, subscribe, and read it every day. Your definition of ""Good"" will be different from mine, but best to steer clear of anything Times of India-ish, i.e. whose definition of news skews towards only Bollywood, sports and politics. Physical papers in my mind are much better, but e-papers (actual subscriptions, *not* just the website) are good too. 

* Read (good) books, on topics surrounding the issues discussed in the news. Nothing happens in a vacuum, and everything has historicity. That historicity may not be evident at first glance, and so reading books that give you context will help you deep dive.

* Google things when you read them and you don't have context. Or, if you don't have time, write them down on a note or something and revisit them later. 

* Understand the rough difference between news, opinions, and events. The event is the important thing that is happening. ""News"" is updates on the facts that surround those events. Opinions are interpretations by experts on the facts that surround the event. Not all events are important, not all news is real/relevant, and not all opinions are true. 

* Develop your understanding from multiple sources. Context is important, facts are important, history is important. Any one source will miss out on some of all of those three. 

* Use your head. If something seems to good to be true, it often is. so that's when you deep dive and do a little digging to understand what isn't being told to you. This is the part where you change from being a passive consumer of news to an active participant in current events. 

* Attend public talks, public panel discussions, book launches, etc. that are in your area (if you live in a major city). a lot of them are masturbatory exercises in self-aggrandisement, but they usually have experts who have had time to hone convincing arguments that are worth listening to even if you don't believe them ultimately.

* Learn how to form your own opinion. Everything should be questioned. Even if you're Jordan Peterson or Ben Shapiro fan, be one after doing the proper leg work and thinking about what they're saying. 


**Don'ts**

* Do not rely on apps, blogs, and youtube channels. Apps will always shorten the information, so you don't get the detailed discussion: at best you'll get a few extra sentences to a headline that give you the wrong context entirely: InShorts is a horrible app and it becomes *very* obvious when someone's entire argument is derived from an InShorts piece (or for that matter, a reddit post). Blogs can be great sources of information perspectives that could otherwise be suppressed, but you need to be sure that you have the ability to separate the bullshit from usefulness. There are blogs out there that unequivocally support demonetisation, for instance. The same goes for youtube channels: there's only so much they can dive into a topic, and there's a lot that goes unsaid. They're great for getting some background and as a starting point in some instances, but they *cannot* form the entirety of your understanding of a topic. Or rather, they should not. 

* Do not read a billion different sources. Not all events have equally weighted sides (e.g.: Climate change). And honestly, trying to find a billion sources can become exhausting. Pick a main source you tend to trust, and a few others to cross-check.

* Do not watch TV panels on a regular basis. 99% of the time, the amount of time and energy you waste on watching a panel on TV would be better served reading something.

* Do not use Reddit as more than a jumping-off point. Reddit is great as an aggregator of links that are useful, and it's fun to talk to others and see what opinions people have about news that's happening, but it's not a substitute for doing your own legwork. It's an echo-chamber.


**My own imperfect means of staying current**

1. I use The Hindu as my main source of information.

2. I've set up an RSS feed using Feedly to access the Press Information Bureau website for government updates

3. I read a lot. And Google/wikipedia what I don't know, and then use the sources contained therein to go deeper when I have the time. (this helps me when something's happening on, say, Twitter, where I can find out what's happening without getting sucked into it).

4. I will very occasionally watch Lok Sabha TV/ Rajya Sabha TV

5. I'll always read links that friends send my way, because I'm lucky enough to have informed  friends so even if 
what they send is complete trash, it's still trash worth having a glance at. The old school way, newspapers and magazines. Especially the editorial sections. Whatever you do, don't use reddit and r/india as a source to better understand Indian politics or news. Freaking biased as fuck Read the hindu and watch RSTV shows the Big picture, india's world, policy watch and security scan As others mentioned, read newspapers. Understand differences between editorials, opinions and facts. Read books. History, politics etc. There's no one textbook that you can read and understand entire politics. Start with India's political history, read India After Gandhi. 

If you travel, I recommend listening to podcasts. It takes the weight off your shoulders of finding relevant topics. The Seen and the Unseen is a good podcast, Newslaundry has some good ones - Hafta and Charcha. You'll only get a better understanding by exposing yourself to multiple ideas - newspapers, books, podcasts etc. And keep away from any apps that try to save your time. Understanding news and making sense of it takes time, there's no way around that. Apps that try to save your time will eventually turn click baity. Vision ias monthly current affairs . They are concise and free of cost . I am cereal readin papers don't work cause it functions with presupposed familiarity. because they don't have infinite space. so first you gotta contextualize it. talk to people. because there is no beginner-oriented source I know of, except your smart friends. 

slightly longer path: correct way to read papers: pick the biggest stories of the paper, doesn't matter which paper. cover story of the Sunday et, etc. strongly suggest the epapers...just select and Google what you don't get..

another pointer: read up on past scandals..it's a finished story, not one you have to watch unfold over weeks/months, it's got the most info on the underbelly if there is one, and it gives you greater idea about the economy and it's structure, which does not change over decades.. 

slowly you'll start being able to contextualise the lakh crores, the budget, get a broad overview of the industries, etc. it's a long path but an important one, I'm also just beginning it. fucking genx left us fuckall in terms of infrastructure, pollution, population, we have to wade into their muck now.. Not sure if someone has already suggested this but podcasts are a GREAT way to catch up on Indian politics and current affairs. I listen to News and Views and the Big Story. Both of them are by the Quint and regularly add short episodes. There's also The Seen and the Unseen which has much longer discussions. The Pragati Podcast and Ganatantra are pretty good too. 

Talking Books is one of my favourites. They invite authors and discuss their books. Topics are wide ranging. It's by Indian Express. Stop browsing r/India for news. You if want just news then subscribe to newslaundry. It does a podcast named ""Daily Dose"" which gives short and quick about what's happening around. I get a lot of news here, r/india The Hindu Knappily I wouldn’t recommend YouTube. Most of them are click bait crap this sub Trust me, every news channel is either biased or paid. Like NDTV will show all bad for BJP and Zee News will show all good. The only thing that is left is our good old DD News.

While no one can claim to be unbiased. I do strive hard to cover all sides. Twitter. I'd say begin with the foundation - Civics. You should know the basics of how the government functions - when and why we have elections, how the budget is voted on, which committees have power over what. Just pick one like the CAG, and get the general sense of how it works. Then maybe look at the judiciary, learn the difference between the high court, supreme court, etc. Get the big picture first and understand how the country works. Armed with this knowledge you will more easily be able to spot bullshit like for e.g. Economic reports, which are based on data collected from such and such committee/census/survey. If you know that numbers are only generated once per year, its easy to spot a lie when a politician manipulates them to mean something else. Or how and when development funds are allocated. So if a politician claims credit, you'll know that those funds were allocated 10 years ago. So many little things. Then you can try to get into geo-poltics and foreign affairs. What are the treaties that we are a co-signer on.. how have we developed our trade relations with other countries, etc. Then maybe a bit about economics.. what is inflation, how does the RBI set interest rates, etc. You don't need to go super deep into every topic.  Maybe you can then go into regional politics. What is the history of the Shiv Sena - BJP alliance in Maharashtra and how the NCP plays into this, or the differences between the DMK and the AIADMK and the historical nature of their rivalry. 

The only advice I'd give is don't get too caught up with current news. It takes months and years to generate detailed analysis of things. Try to stay away from these ""breaking news"" type articles, which are always light on real information. They only have superficial information of who said what and that stuff only matters if you care about drama. 

A country doesn't work like a rickshaw where it can change its course at any given minute, its a giant slow-moving super-tanker. Many events which might seem super important because people talk about them a lot, will eventually seem irrelevant because in the grand scheme of things, the direction of the super-tanker didn't change even a bit. * TheLiar.in for far LW

> On Sunday, Atishi said: “They cannot question the work of AAP government and they cannot talk about their own work. This is why they are spreading lies about my caste and religion. It indicates that Lovely is going to lose his deposit and has accepted defeat,” she said.

Why should it matter even if she were a Jew? And so what if she's Jewish? Shame on Congress for not only lying about it, but for making the fact of someone being Jewish a political issue. Shame. Congress will save us from the communal politics Heh, the last 48 hours have been zany. We had our own ""The Jew fears the Samurai"" moment. Jew ho ya mountain dew as long as she is good candidate I would vote for her. Her work and ethics are her choice, the religion she was born in sadly isn't. People need to get their priorities right I don't know.  Hardcore sanghis love Israel.  So I guess they would vote for Atishi - wouldn't they? Indian politics is just based on caste and religion.

She dropped her traditional surname and adopted for a surname ""marlena"", which is derived from Marx and Lenin. She wanted that people should judge her based on her work rather than her lineage. 

But if a political party is spreading false rumors about her, she has to defend it. There is nothing wrong if she would have been a Jew. But have a common voter would have voted for a Jew Atishi. No, because no one cares about the real work done by the candidate, it all boild down to what your caste and what is your religion. First time ever I've heard of someone being called a Jew in India as a negative thing. Usually we love Israelis, esp in Goa.

So anti-semitism has reared its ugly head here as well? Damn. Practicing Muslim and a hardcore anti-zionist here.


I don't give a single shit if she's a jew. She did more in 5 years for her constituency than what Muslim Leaders in mine for the last 20 years.

[My reaction](https://www.meme-arsenal.com/memes/34a8769b087cc34940b919533bbc2dfc.jpg) The funniest part was that she took everyone for a ride. There was so much support for her on Twitter. And now all of them would be repenting it. 

LPT: Never support a politician. And she's joined the Shiv Sena.. lmao Few points independent of each other

- Goons and lumpen elements in the party are shameful. For morality and decency, they should have been dealt with.  The blame on the incident is only on the those people and no one else. 

- She was a great spokesperson. Made good contrubutions to the party. A loss for the party no matter how you put it. 

- If the reports of her joining the Shiv Sena are true then, well that party has no shortage of goons either. It would have been better if she had joined another party, AAP, JDS, TRS etc. Any party except this. 

Anyway best of luck to her. I am sorry for the way she was treated. Everyone knows shiv senas selling point is women empowerment. She spoke of secularism  
Now she joined shiv sena  
Once a lodu said  
Hypocrisy ki bhi hoti hai seema In chutiyon ke liye ideology wideology kuch nahi hai. Sirf ticket dedo toh kutte ki tarah wafadaari karenge Good for her to take a stand. Congress probably needs her more than she needs Congress, and how much of leaders would Scindia and RG be if they cant fight for the right thing within their own party. I wonder what song will Priyanka Chaturvedi sing after joining Shiv Sena later on. It was ""Rishto ke bhi roop badalte hai, naye naye saanche mein dhalte hai"" few days back. ""Ek political party se jaenge, ek pe aagaye hain"" will suit her today. Damn. She took a hard plunge. From being National Spoke person of INC to joining a regional party which don't even have a proper post of spoke's person. She is not getting any ticket from SS in this election. Even if she gets MLA ticket in the next election, SS cadre will not support her. There are no prominent Women leader in SS and that is because of their feudal mindset. Besides she is from UP. Sometimes I think I do not understand politics at all. Good for her. She wasn't given the due importance in the party anyway because of inter politics within her own party. Her [tweet](https://twitter.com/priyankac19/status/1119130478626271232) including the resignation letter. I used to like her. The way she put her argument and how she was always trying to fight for the right and seemed like someone trustable. I admired her for leaving Congress for supporting her harassers but now after joining Shiv Sena, I don't know how true that harassment story is and the garb of caring for others and minorities and stuff is definitely up.

Dynastic politics is bad only because people get their place from influence, if thats not the case then it's fine.

And a misogynistic party like BJP need to be defeated by a woman to show them their place. I will call 2024 as Thanos's endgame from the hands of congress. 2019 was not the year. They all were too late. When Priyanka joined in Jan, she took the headlines for a month before BJP had to do pulwama to take all the attention away. After that, there has been no looking back for BJP.

 You could do what you like career wise, make a name for yourself through your work and then try to enter politics. Since you have some sort of base, Political parties (PP) would be more willing to take you in as you would be able to bring in votes. 

If you are an absolute nobody then why will a PP take you in as an MLA/MP ? They will ask you join as a volunteer. If you really want to be a MP/MLA then they would ask you for money. After all, you are bringing in no benefit (votes) to the party. Think of it as admission to a college, if you do not qualify through exam, i.e earn a seat through merit, then you'll have to give ""donation"" for your seat. 

If you're really serious about a political career I would suggest beginning through some sort of social work. Most of the great leaders of the Independence movement began their careers through some form of social work. This was either directly through organizing peasant/worker demands for better working conditions or fighting social evils or indirectly such as legal help in courts or spreading education.

Or you could pursue a professional career and make a name. You could join the civil services, become an IAS, do good work build a base in a district and then join politics. You could become an engineer or researcher, build/invent/discover something, make a name for yourself and then join politics. 

If you directly wish to enter politics now, you would join a PP as a worker of the party and the chances of climbing the ranks to become a MP/MLA are low since there are so many like you. Instead join politics by fighting for the political rights of the weaker sections, build a base and then join a PP.

To discuss policies, if you're into IT/Business you could explore creating an Indian version of [Change a view](https://changeaview.com/cav/posts) built by the folks at /r/changemyview and recently [shared by Obama] (https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/bj2t51/barack_obama_shares_five_articles_in_a_facebook/). Something which allows discussion and debate instead of user driven answers (Quora) or popular comments (Reddit) Independent journalism. There's a lot of people who took this approach. Paurush Sharma started from scratch and now has over 100K subs on YouTube. I have been watching his videos since he had less than 5K subs. All this happened within a span of a couple of months or so.

Once you gain some traction and politicians start recognizing you, you can jump into it Probably get on twitter and start replying to people of high stature to get recognised. Have a youtube channel and a facebook page. It is easier now due to social media. Select a small regional party and post in support of them. It would be better if the party doesn't have a clear ideology. So, if you help them to form some ideologies you would get promoted soon. Politics is a popularity contest within a geographically defined target audience. 

&#x200B;

How do you score well in such a contest?

&#x200B;

\- By targeting the people in the *geographically defined* audience (not by becoming a youtube star across a geographically broad audience in a narrow socioeconomic stratum)

\- 100% people in that constituency should know you by name

\- At least 35% people in that constituency should consider you a *useful* person to their self-interest (not knowledgeable)

\- At least 50% of people in that constituency *like* you positively

\- Make strategic alliances with people in power.

\- Make strategic alignments with the large groups in the constituency, may be on business, caste, religious or other lines. Various groups of people in that constituency should consider your interests aligned to theirs.

\- Work on your public persona, including voice, looks etc

\- arrange for some war chest of funds, everything costs money

&#x200B;

Use these to first build a base, then you can do the ""right"" things later on. The best politicians have an unassailable home constituency. That allows them to take anti-majority liberties without always being too conscious. You can't do this until you can get in power, but if you don't have any connections and don't have money and can't scare people, then you can't directly get into politics. At your age, you focus on studying then getting a good job. Once you have job, responsibilities, family you will be a mature person who understands how society works. Then you can get into politics.

As per the sangh, they are never about destroying India's soul. They are about **rediscovering** India's soul that was destroyed and denatured (but never completely!) over a period of 1000 years by un-Indian and anti-Indian foreign forces. That in fact is the entire motive for Hindutva.

If you want to start talking to the sangh (and the vast majority of Indians who support them) and be taken seriously, you at least must make an attempt to understand where they are coming from. All I see from the left are comical caricatures of the sangh's position. The bjp cleverly hijacked the mass sentiments that was high after the failed “india against corruption” movement. India at that time was heading towards a revolution. They just positioned themselves as a political alternative to a system collapse/revolution. People had become disillusioned with our system rife with corruption and extortionism-  and it was at a time when social media was just getting traction. the bjp realised that social media had exhausted itself in the urban areas but was slowly increasing in the rural areas (even in 2019 its rising). They did the math and successfully set a colour (saffron) to their movement - along with advertising and bollywood style narratives. It was a master plan. It is now a Hindu Rashtra. r/IslaminIndia 

A new sub, please join and spread the word. Only approved posts so far but we hope to build the community quickly! wouldn’t take The Guardian very seriously (other than sports coverage) - they have a well known left bias and don’t even bother hiding it anymore. If I were speaking to Modi after the win, this is what I would say to him:

It is not because of your competence that you have won, it is because of opposition's incompetence.

&#x200B;

If the face of the Congress was Scindia, Pilot or even Tharoor, I am willing to bet the election would have turned out very very differently. 
Let me tell you a story

This all started when Janath Party got trashed in 1984 elections and had only 2 MP's....

So Advani went on mutli year long hindutva yatras encouraging communal violence culminating with Ram Mandir destruction which caused then PM VP Sing ordering Advani and team arrested even though he was PM due to BJP alliance.

When BJP pulled their support, VP Singh government fell. This is when VP Singh stood up in parliament and asked the question ""What type of India do you want""

BJP won at ton of seats in the 1991 elections and has been using communalism since then to gain vote banks....and we are seeing that clash going on today. Now I am not saying other parties do no use religion to gain votes, but no one did it the way BJP did it..

Godhra incident is directly correlated to Advanis hindutva yatras encouraging communal violence

This will all go away in about 15 years when people realize religion and politics just do not mix...because the over whelming majority of people in India just wants to have a decent life where we get along with our neighbors irrespective of cast, creed, religion.

That is the kind of India we Indians believe in and thats what we want for our kids fuck the guardian > During this spring’s campaign, he also clarified that he is an unreconstructed ethnic-religious supremacist, with fear and loathing as his main political means.

This is from Pankaj Mishra's NYT piece. Really, NaMo ""clarified"" that? Where is the link, Mishraji, or are you the one simply a hater here clarifying on his behalf? India is not as polarized as made out by western media. All the vile hate agenda being relentlessly thrown at Modi has only helped the lotus bloom. And the ""we know what's better for you than you do"" tone is not helpful either. It is condescending to the Indian voter and insult to the Indian democracy. Biased af, outstanding journalism! For all those who are painting a gloomy picture after the elections and telling the world how fucked up this country is, know this fact, that wherever you go, whatever you do, you'll always be an Indian. You can't escape that identity. And when you meet a friend from abroad, he'll point a finger at you saying; 'bloody savage Indian.' Hope that makes you proud.

Why not change the way things are happening? Why don't you leave your cushy life and start working for the masses like Atishi and hope to change people's mindset for the better? It's easier to sit in an ac room and type away in a keyboard and complain incessantly, but actually taking charge and changing things is a whole different ballgame. I am no pro-modi. I am no anti-modi too. My concerns are targeted towards India as a country.   

My biggest concern is the way media has been portraying the Modi Government for the past few years. There is no spine to criticise the government at all for any unfavourable decisions. Sure, the good work has to be praised. Credit has to be given where its due. But at what expanse. It feels as if the media houses have become the official spokespersons of the NDA. And anyone critical about their views has become an anti-national. Every time a relevant question is asked by anyone, he is targeted by the IT brigade. 

Media is considered the 4th pillar of a democracy  throughout the world for a reason. The reason to be rational and critical of the people in power. The reason to praise the good work done by the people in power. The reason to become the voice of the public. In contrast the media houses in our country seem to be defending the government against the right questions. 

Look at all the interviews our beloved PM gave prior to the elections. Not a single journalist showed spine to ask the relevant questions. India's soul is already lost. The bigot which was lying dormant has been awakened. UK who is gonna cancel the Brexit referendum because they are not happy with the first result wants to give a lesson on politic ? Funny.

Really saddened.

&#x200B;

Saw a news article of how Vajpayee credited Rao for the Nuclear tests. Can we imagine Modi crediting anything to previous governments ? or anyone in the current opposition doing anything similar if they come to power!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;","We are the nation of Sardar Patel, of Pandit Nehru, of Mahatma Gandhi, of Lal Bahadur Shastri, of Indira(with all her shortcomings), of PV Narsimha Rao, of the great Vajpayee. How did we come to Sonia, Rahul, and to Amit Shah, and Modi?"
585,Politics,"They are dead now. We talk about the alives.  We are the same nation. We have realised that India doesn't grow because of politicians but inspite of them. They aren't so important anymore and because they lost their importance, their shortcomings are highlighted more than their predecessors. We are always led to believe that nothing ever works. I don’t like the current state of journalism and media, the discourse has gotten to a low point. Didn’t expect it to be this bad tbh.  The times they are a changin. bcz in that era there was struggle for independence, current regime had nothing to fight for everything was gifted to them and hence taken for granted. When situation is tough , you get molded by it . Now its all politics and hidden agenda where nations priorities takes last place thats why this situataion  We are the people responsible for it. Past always seems better than it is.  Manmohan saved the country at least twice from immediate impending disaster - once in 1991 (LPG) and again in 2008 (Kasab, by not going to war). Don't forget we successfully dodged two major global financial crises - 1997 and 2008 Everyone looks at the past and thinks there are great leaders there. We spent 40+ years in an economic disastrous policy. We should have changed course in 10 years but many people still think state socialism is the the greatest thing since sliced bread.  After few decades, depending on the govt in power these current netas will be portrayed in great honor in the school textbook. Pretty interesting how you can disregard the shortcomings of Indira Gandhi (who came closest to becoming a dictator) but can call out Sonia, Rahul, Amit Shah and Modi. 

In any case, intellectual capacity is not the unit if measurement nor a requirement for the post of PM. It's their ability to connect to the masses. Most of these people have that, whether you like it or not. Modi in particular gives pretty powerful speeches (in Hindi) that are actually well crafted. 

It's also funny how nearly everyone brings up Vajpayee to claim some sort of neutrality in their assessment but he was voted out despite his relatively successful term.  What's wrong with Sonia ,Rahul ,Amit ,Modi ? We have a tendency to glorify people and events of the past.

Just because the leaders you listed are of the past doesn't make them all stalwarts. For example, Shastri was not a stalwart, although he was a good person and a good PM for a brief period.  Indira Gandhi was the original dictator. She was the prototype of Modi. As for Narsimha Rao, if there is anything good is to be said of him, it's his decision of liberalisation of the Indian economy. His choice of Manmohan Singh as FM must be commended, too. But he is, above all, one of the wiliest politicians India has ever seen. He was not a mass leader. He was a Congress party apparatchik.

Now for Vajpayee. On what basis is he being lauded now? Yes, he is less despicable than Modi, agreed. But here was a man who allowed the Gujarat pogrom to happen, and, even more egregiously, made the most callous remark about the cause of the pogrom. This man, like Modi, was only good for ornate speeches. Nothing else, nada. For some reason, he and Kalaam are the most overestimated, hyped leaders of the past.

Now for the most glaring remark in your post - Sonia Gandhi. Mrs. Gandhi decided to stay away from politics after her husband's death. Understandably traumatised not just by her husband's death but the way he was assassinated, although the party leadership was hers for the asking, and later, presumably, the PM post. In her place, Rao ruled for 5 years. At the end of it, he didn't leave the Congress party smelling of roses.

Meanwhile, the Congress party was ruled by all kinds of people. Sitaram Kesri was the nadir. Pundits had written off Congress as a has-been force in Indian politics.

It was at this time that so-called regional satraps like Arjun Singh, Chithambaram, Anthony etc. queued outside 10, Janpath, beseeching her to enter politics. It was due to their compulsion that she agreed.

The rest is truly historic. She was the opposition leader in the next Vajpayee government. She formed the government in 2004. A Indian woman of Italian origin was voted by the Indian people. Truly remarkable. The people didn't vote for Manmohan Singh (who was not even in the reckoning) or Scindia or anyone else. They voted for Sonia Gandhi. Let's fucking admit it. She turned around the Congress party from the lows of 1997 to form the government in 2014. Let's give credit where it is due. And was she a one act wonder? No, she won again in 2009. Some critics may say it was due to the incumbency factor, just the same way they say that Vajpayee lost the 2004 elections due to anti-incumbency. Whatever fuck, it was a good government. She won again, and, alas, floundered.

Meanwhile, Modi's propaganda had started. Everyone from Motilal Nehru to Indira Gandhi's parentage was fabricated. I even read some shit about how Indira Gandhi's bloodline was of, wait for it, Timurlane! Anyway, the propoganda worked. That's why people of certain ilk and of certain generation seems to think Sonia Gandhi's two successful terms - let's admit it was she people voted for - as some sort of a fluke. That's why people fail to mention the remarkable feat of only the third leader in Indian history, after Nehru and Indira Gandhi, to win back to back general elections to form the govt.

I admit I have left out many moles and warts from this ""glowing"" account. Feel free to add it, but take away not the remarkable aspect, too. Was there corruption? Yes, in oodles. Was there backroom buying and selling of votes of opportunistic parties, such as Mulayam Singh's? Yes, in buckets.

Yet we must admit that it is indeed remarkable that a late, reluctant entrant to Indian politics; of Italian-origin, and a woman, made a complete turnaround in the fortunes of India's oldest political party within 5 years. And it is remarkable not only of her but of the Indian people, who, unlike some richer, more democratic, more educated nations, didn't think her gender or place of birth important when voting for her.

&#x200B; caste. harms meritocracy.  the leaders which you have mentioned as inspiring , were formed during the indian struggle for independence , they could have their difference is their approach , but they did want India as a nation to improve. since politics at that time was largely a reserve of educated and rich , as a corollary to that they did not appeal to lowest of human emotions namely religoin, caste and class issues, and issues of education , infrastructure and health were used to fight politics .

Once that generation died down , the coming generation didn't have the moral values which come with living in the time of fighting for your nation, to win elections they resort to most common issues which everybody can relate to,i.e religion and caste.

&#x200B;

this situation has gotten worse , with every middle class parents advice to their children that do whatever you want but don't join politics or don't do social work  , just get a good job, house and get married 

&#x200B;

Seriously what do people think will change , with this kind of attitude?

From NYTimes article in 1979 - The then US Ambassador to India (1973-75). D P Moynihan claims in his biography:

> “In 1974 Mrs. Gandhi was still making speeches about the ever‐present danger of subversion by the C.I.A., while I was talking to the relevant Indian officials about our common interest in China. In New Delhi I had pressed the embassy to go back over the whole of our quartercentury in India, to establish just what we had been up to. In the end I was satisfied that we had been up to very little. We had twice, but only twice, interfered in Indian politics to the extent of providing money to a political party. Both times this was done in the face of a prospective Communist victory in a state election, once in Kerala and once in West Bengal. Both times the money was given to the Congress Party, which had asked for it. Once it was given to Mrs. Gandhi herself, who was then a party official.”

And also, in his autobiography on Feroze Gandhi, *the Forgotten Gandhi*, historian Bertil Falk has said that 



> Indira was very upset at EMS Nambodripad and Communists coming into power, and she urged her father to outright dismiss the govt, but he dithered. She used the disturbances using pet AICC cronies in Kerala to widen the scope of the protests and make it to be an immense law and order problem.

 You cannot miss Ravish Kumar on NDTV at 9 PM, Monday-Friday. Start watching from tonight. Politics has a high age barrier. You can become MLA/MP only at 25 years. Getting tickets from a established party involves dirty money. More than reading books - you should try to be apprentice to a popular local MLA or MP or even Ward representative. If you want to know how the government actually works, watch ""Consti-tuition"" at https://www.newslaundry.com/category/consti-tuition 

These are videos about the working of our constitution. I am also planning to watch it. (Been meaning to do so since it was launched...) Talk to working class people on the streets about their issues. If you are really serious about getting into politics, then I would recommend you:
1) Read history and governance. It is important to know history.
2) Travel. Begin with your own state. Take a bus/train, and travel to different parts. Talk to different sections of people, farmers, villagers, service class, business class; meet them, in fact I would say  stay with the villagers, understand rural India and how economy and society functions there. Their need and lifestyle is way different than cities and you will meet and understand the real India. Almost all the big leaders have traveled throughout the country in their early life to understand India. Gandhi ji traveled throughout India before taking part in freedom struggle, and that helped him immensely.

As you said you have a sheltered life, like most of us, it is pretty hard to understand the problems of others. If you try to understand issues only through media and newspapers, then I dont think you will ever succeed.

A politician knows everything about his region, what/where/why is happening in which part of the town and media is not really a reliable source. You need to know things yourself because this will help you to use the situation in your favour, and studying people and their psyche will help you to rise above.

As I said earlier, travelling and meeting people will help you see and read people. A good politician is a good reader of people's brain and he does that by talking to them. It will also help you know which region has what kind of people and what resource which you can use for your benefit, media cant help you in this thing. As it is your beginning, I think, you can do that easily, also when you join any organisation in future these understandings will help you rising the cadre.
 RSTV for news, The Hindu for newspaper.  Main stream media is not an answer for anything. For entering politics you must know how India works, for that you should first have to get familiar with our constitution. You should build your personality, effective thinking , speech , history , general knowledge, and most important argument skills. The best way of learning that is to study law, (I know politics and law are different things but they are interrelated and gives you the best chance about knowing our Indian politics. Read books of our leaders like M.K. Gandhi, Nehru, Abdul Kalam , etc. these books will give an idea of how a leader should think and work.(these methods were related to study and theoretical knowledge ) For practical knowledge you should join right wing organisations like RSS, Yuva Sena, etc many indian politicians come from such organisations. Or if you are old enough like 23-25 then join any party that you like and become a member, do as they say, learn from them be loyal to them, eventually after some years you will get a chance to contest an election. You will have to wait for a long time for a ticket as their is fierce competition and everyone wants to win.Hope this comment helped you if their is anything extra that I forgot to write I will add that later. Thanks. For an overview of historical context Ramachandra Guha's *India after Gandhi* (for a center, and arguably center-right, perspective) and Vijay Prashad's *No Free Left* (to explain the gains, failures and promises of left-wing political movements in India)  are two relatively accessible texts.  i highly recomend to watch this "" The Rules for Rulers video by CGP Grey

Become local neta ka gunda. Get a few kills under your belt. You will be overqualified if you have any formal education whatsoever. You could start by watching morning fix by scroll.in [link](https://www.youtube.com/user/WatchScroll). They have short encapsulated videos on what is relevant for the day. You might want to start by reading this book :India after Gandhi - Ramchandra Guha.  If you want to really follow politics, you basically need to read a bit. Rome was not built in a day, neither did u/theparhelionn learn it all in one.  

Start by reading newspapers/news websites - plural. The idea is to get a different facets of the same news.  So maybe, you start reading Indian Express, The Hindu, The wire (web only)... this is a nice starting point. Read political discussions in all three but just stick to one paper/website for the basic news/sports etc. 

Now add some reputable global newspapers. E.g. New York Times, or the Guardian, or the Washington Post. They will not have much on India, but if you scan them after big events (say the pulwama attack), you get to read another view point. 

Occasionally, dig into subjects you find interesting. Maybe it is the Rafale deal, maybe it is Ayodhya, maybe it is Terrorism in India. 

Go deep - for example, if you choose Rafale, search on Google,  turn to Wikipedia and then skim the page and go through the references.   What was the deal about, what was the time line, how many planes, why did our order get delayed, why was the F16 not chosen, why was the Tejas not chosen, what is happening to the 126 fighter requirement, where does anil ambani fit into the picture, how was the original deal better, what are the good points about modi's deal, ... ... and on and on. 

As you do this, you will slowly increase your knowledge about politics, news organizations, and get an idea on who/what is trustworthy news source and what is not.

So the opposition is asking for proof of the airstrikes and the govt has not given the proof till now. Now, it will be foolish to assume that the ruling party didn't anticipate this kind of a response from the opposition considering the kind of opposition they have put up in the past. So, if the ruling party had already assumed that the opposition will come up with this kind of an opposition, then it must have put measures to counter that as well. And it is highly likely that the measure is to release proof of the airstrikes just before the elections so that it remains fresh in the minds of the people. 

Now, if the oppositions is also smart enough and have anticipated this future response, they also must be holding something in their arsenal which they intend to release before the elections. But I don't know if they are smart enough or they playing to the hands of the ruling party by protesting. Remember, if there are no voices asking for proof, then the whole thing of giving proof won't fetch the desired result. Simple demand and supply. Asking for proof is the demand.

Within TN post independence rationalist, and Tamil movements took root allowing little space for Hindutva politics of RSS or Hindu Mahasabha. Even congress's influence waned  after Kamaraj. DMK continued to propagate athiestic world view( unless electorally inconvenient) whereas AIADMK has always been ambivalent about religion. JJ was never overly athiestic. 

As rationalist politics and Tamil  pride politics got run  over by caste politics and welfare measures
, there are some pockets especially in the upper caste who want to wear their religion on their sleeves, and have also felt marginalized these many decades. Remember these were the 'villains'  in the Periyar and Anti caste movements. This minority is now turning towards hindutva.

 AIADMK becoming a BJP puppet, and  BJP's vast spending on PR and social media lends greater visibility as well.



Kerala is surprisingly conservative as a society. BJP has managed to infest a few pockets, and has piggy backed on the Sabarimala issue (after initially supporting entry of women). They have had  nearly no impact on electoral politics till now though.



Karnataka is the only state where BJP has been able to form a govt. 

Thing to note here is that unlike other southern states Karnataka was not administered as a single entity pre independence. Karnataka today is an amalgamation of Mysore kingdom, North Karnataka ( part of Bombay province) and other parts of Madras presidency. Though a common language and past empires ( Hoysala, Satavahana , Vijayanagar etc) united the territories within the state, a cohesive state consciousness and politics is yet to emerge in my opinion.  

Different parts of Karnataka have thier political heavyweights. Mysore region dominated by JD(S) with Congress second. NK Congress. Coastal Karnataka and Malnad is where BJP is strongest. In fact coastal areas have suffered from the poison of hatred filled saffron cultural goondaism ( remember Sri Ram Sene and the pink chaddi movement? ). 

Although there have been rationalist movements in the past, and rationalist literature has seen its hey  day, hindutva's appeal is mainly political except for pockets mentioned earlier. 

I have no clue about AP and TN Mainly because they only resonate with the ""Hindu"" part. To them Modi, RSS and bjp stand for ""Hindutva"" or ""Hinduism"" . Also a lot of the supporters mostly belong to upper caste Brahmins who feel Rss and BJP alone are a party worth voting for (never mind how they are actually treated) and see Congress as a ""non hindu/Muslim party"". [deleted] In South it's usually the upper castes who have this North culture(Hindi Sanskrit and cow) worshipping nature. For them native culture of their land is not their culture. If you ask some Tamil brahmins they will claim sanskrit is their mother tongue.

This also explains why Marathi brahmins have historically been pro Hindi and running the RSS instead of sticking to Marathi language.

How much this narrative affects the state politics is function of their population and influence.
That explains the clear irrelevance of this hindi-hindu ideology in TN and it's significance elsewhere  I think it's just hatred towards Muslims that drives them to RSS/hindutva.  Everyone votes based on caste lines. Even the upper caste people. Who will have a higher representation on social media.  [deleted] 1. Conversions and Other religions: By making them the strawmen.
2. Positive Image: Because they are projecting themselves as representatives/guardians of Hinduism.

They paint English as the destructive force. Gandhi kinda comes off as racist and undoubtedly casteist. He is a bad marker of moral behvaiour tbh.  [deleted] Wow, slow clap OP!

This discussion is petty at best. If anything, the RSS wants a United India, not a country further squabbling about who's from the North and what language they speak of.

&#x200B;

What good is sustained economic growth if there is no Mandir?

&#x200B; I’m not a BJP supporter but... This seems to be the current problem of almost all conservative movements worldwide. Their rise is explained to factors like;

*  the rise in global terrorism (esp. Jihadism due to decades of turmoil in the middle east), 

* water and agrarian crises, 

* displacement of people due to conflict

* lack of opportunity (the inability to be upwardly mobile), etc 

But these factors have an underlying cause in many complex modern phenomena like climate change and globalization. 

In many large democracies, the symptoms of these complex unresolved problems are dealt locally - by banding together - hence the rise of identity politics - where the toxic economic rationale follows the faulty premises of conservative populists.

Conservative movements often cloak simplistic and experimental solutions as economic breakthrough (Demonitization? What about doing away with Income Tax? ). The rationale of political Modi bhakti/ Trumpism lies elsewhere - in social & economic anxiety and racism/ Hindutva. 

That is the actual point - identity politics is used to break democratic compromise because justified or not, voters feel there *is* socio-economic turmoil to be addressed. And they vote in the first demagogue or hare-brained referendum that presents itself.

In the end, you are left with broken promises (Brexit/ end of economic crime via Demo) because the original premise was not very well-thought through. So when the economy goes south, leaders can only ratchet up lying to hide their failures.

620,Business/Finance,"It's very simple.

The only reason Urjit Patel, who offered no resistance to the government's draconian demonetisation move, flipped out when the government asked the RBI to loosen its reserves is even he realises how dangerous a move this is.

Jaitley is out there behaving like an ignorant child saying the RBI has 3 lakh crores of ""surplus"" when in actuality, it's ""reserves"". No one knows when the economy will go haywire.

The world's best economists didn't see the 2008 disaster coming. So these reserves are just that. Reserves!

And since Urjit didn't bend, the government kicked him out. You think this was a resignation? No, it was a firing that was timed to perfection.

The replacement was announced on election result day so it gets burried in the election news.

Mr. Das with his master's in history will offer nothing but support to the government's ideas.

Modi wants the reserves to come out, creating a temporary surge in growth. He will also announce a lot of people friendly schemes in run up the the 2019 Elections.

If these things happen, he truly will have fucked up the economy. I'm buying lube and preparing my anus. Demo 2.0 is right around the corner They got Das for one simple reason. For the ~~1 lakh~~ 3 lakh crore that Jaitley and gang are eyeing. 

The request for that money to be given from RBI reserve, will come in a week or two. 

In a month, there’ll be more loans being dolled out by banks, more mudi kaka posters, more photo ops, more statues of mudi kaka himself if possible and Ofcourse, for ram mandir. 

These people will leave the country in ashes.  I have one request from all of you(people who understand beyond Mandir-Masjid, BJP-Cong). Start educating people on our parliamentary system about MLAs MPs start with your friends, your domestic help tell them how it is done, counsel them(not on which party to vote for but how it affects them). 

Let's start something from our side to save whatever we have left! [deleted] >What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. 

I hope the opposition takes to the social media and tells us what these people are up to. Most of us have a bare minimum education in matters of economics.  [removed] He's got a history degree and has no idea about the economics. He's a government yes man,a puppet.

The government wants to take a huge risk and damage the countries financial stability,in return for short term gains.

The movement of wealth from cash to bonds shows that this is just too risky Dude is MA History.  All his predecessors have been PhD in Economics and Banking.  He is just a Jately lapdog.   Why do you think Dr. Kurian didn't think highly of IAS folks, they are generalists not specialists. Das will help with the looting, this is their second attempt at demo to financially hamstring the opposition and slurp the RBI reserve. Our stewards have turned weak and spineless like Theoden. A reminder to everyone.  RBI asked PayTM to remove the CEO of Paytm payment bank because she did not have any banking experience. And now Jately ji has brought in a no banking experience/no economist(MA History) to head RBI. They think we are retarded. 

And to reply to another comment, these sarkari training certificates have no weight what so ever. I did an MBA from one of these Indian Institute tags and we train many a sarkari afsars usually IAS,IRS and IFS. They just have to attend a few sessions and they get the certificate. Getting a PhD from Yale or Harvard or MIT involves original research work. 

And on top of everything this dude implemented demonetisation.  No economist worth their salt would have let this happen.  I'm not worried if some person without some academic background gets appointed as the Governor of RBI as long as his actions are carefully considered and sane. Also, as other commenter pointed out, it's the board members who make the decisions collectively and we have experts from different fields of study in the board.

With all that said, it's still a very bad decision made by the government. I mean, it's not unexpected that they chose someone who supported the DeMon to the core despite its serious flaws. Also, his politically conservative attitude which he fearlessly displayed in the past is something that's troubling regarding his appointment. I'm supportive of people with very little or no academic background but with sufficient experience working in different related fields of relevance making it into key positions in apex level organizations but this man is clearly chosen with a different motive in mind.

As for the boards and its members being key decisions makers in the organization, I won't be surprised if they're to replaced with other like minded experts as our newly appointed governor if the present members show any kind of disappointment in the decision taking. No organization is devoid of factions but what we've seen till now is that these apex organizations were given a significant freedom to operate on those level of factions that were divided on academic grounds which is undeniably a healthy division. But the recent divisions that developed within the organization are toxic to this organization and thereby to the country as a whole because the core ideology is that of political, rather than being an economic or social one.

This appointment is very much like the appointment of Betsy DeVos as US secretary of education or Kavanaugh's appointment to the US Supreme Court. Abuse of power and unhealthy political involvement in matters that are unrelated. Let's see how this will unfold in times to come.  To me, it matters less what his academic or research credentials are. A lot of people with less formal credentials can do good jobs. What matters more is that he is a Government stooge. Totally agree with you. Mr Das has corruption allegations against him as well.  Pre 2014 RBI was eyeing implementation of basel norms, and now RBI itself is getting its ""pillars"" stripped 😑 He was mouthpiece of government during demo. It's election time and government will try everything possible to remain in power.

RBI reserves will be used as election funds. Loan wievers, ect . Will there be any announcements or news once he hands over a part of the reserve to Mudi Kaka and Blog minister?  I dunno but I get the hunch that even this guy will not be able to tolerate the PM and his gang's nonsense and he will also leave.. Generally (historically) how much time the previous governments taken to decide on the next governer? Daru will help to get over someone 😂 Nothing surprising saar. Inmates running the asylum is trademark of bjp Guys, he's an alumnus of IPE and has a masters in finance from there it seems. Just saying, not stating he's the guy for the job at all, cause he's not. ITT posters citing Wikipedia as source for Shaktikanta Das's qualifications. SMH vigorously.  tax payers are fcuked Why do you bring the rape analogy here! \>   Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit. 

I definitely do not agree with this. The Harvard passouts I have personally met so far have been bitter disappointments. Mostly because expectations from such people are high but also they are usually not experts in their fields or really intend to be. I dont have enough knowledge to say whether this is a good thing or not, But atleast his wikipedia page seem to indicate that he has done schooling in Finance in IIMB and National Institute of Banking Management. He also had held posts in various government revenue organizations.  Not sure, if these are good enough but i dont think they just appointed a guy with just MA History degree as RBI governor. He seems to have some relevant qualification and experience. He has experience in economics related field. PhD in economics doesn't means that you should be selected. Even Raghuram  pursued IIT and later did MBA. Did he had an economic background from the start? No.

This guy might not be the best option but let the guy even work. I know he is a puppet of the government but give some time at least. Turns out he does have a background in finance and management education as suggested by his Wikipedia page To be fair, RBI is supposed to serve the government. If urjit wasn't doing what the government was asking then they have the right to replace him. Because we will blame the government for poor economic policies and vote them out, not the RBI.

What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be.

Bolo kaunsi chahiye 🤣 I know of two such men, both my friend's uncles. 

They're both Muslims from Hyderabad. 

One uncle married a Gujarati Hindu (she had to convert). The wife is a US citizen. Her family has businesses in Chicago and this guy inherited those too. They have two kids. As far as I know, their marriage works well enough. 

Another uncle married an American born daughter of Pakistani Muslim immigrants. She doesn't follow Islam and drinks alcohol, which this guy didn't like, but still went ahead with the marriage.

**Firms looking for a way to change their GST officials** 

 ______ 
A senior finance executive in a private equity firm was visibly worried after
he got a call from goods and services tax (

GST

) officer. The officer on the other end wanted to know more about the
construction business that the company was involved in. It took some time for
the executive to explain that the word ""stone"" in the brand name had nothing
to do with the business the firm was into.

Few kilometres away from the PE firm's office in

Mumbai

, the CFO of a finance company -- that's part of a major conglomerate -- was
nervous too. The CFO was just back from a meeting with the company's

GST assessing officer

, and it left him in knots.

""How does one explain credit

swap

ratio, private placement, and other debt instruments in Hindi?"" he asked his
chartered accountant who had accompanied him. The GST officer too had some
queries about some transactions that were carried out in the past few months.

As the government assigned GST assessing officers from a combined pool of
erstwhile Sales Tax, Excise and Value Added Tax (VAT) officers, many companies
are running scared. Earlier, state officers --mainly VAT -- only dealt with
manufacturing companies and service tax, and excise officials dealt with
service companies including banks, PE firms, NBFCs and insurance companies.

But under GST -- the common indirect tax -- that distinction has disappeared
and all officers now fall under one umbrella. So in several cases, erstwhile
VAT officials have been asked to assess PE firms, banks and finance companies.

Many of these firms are rushing to their tax consultants and desperately
asking them if they can in anyway change their assessing officers.

""There's no mechanism prescribed by the legislation that enables taxpayers to
voice their views on whether they would prefer being assessed by the existing
authorities.

Several service providers, whose business models are well known to the central
authorities and have now been assigned to the state authorities, are
apprehensive that the state authorities will take time to develop expertise on
taxation of services,"" said MS Mani, Partner, Deloitte

India

.

Industry trackers say that for indirect taxes, the importance of assessment
officers become crucial and dealing with them is not just an annual affair
like in the case of income tax. ""One has to deal with officials for refunds,
credits, monthly taxes, etc. The worry is many VAT officials will take some
time before they could understand nitty-gritty of our business,"" the senior
finance executive in the PE firm said.

The government has used a formula for allocation of assessment officers and
dividing work among central and state officers. And this is worrying not just
for PE firms or banks, but also some of the other traders.

Take the instance of an Indian shoe manufacturer that has a turnover of about
Rs 1,000 crore: the manufacturer has got a clean chit from the VAT officials
for the past five years, but is now worried about the heightened scrutiny.

Another diamond exporter based in Crawford Market in Mumbai has also sent out
an SOS to his tax advisors. The exporter, like the shoe manufacturer, wants
former state officers to assess his accounts, and not central officers.

The manufacturer has asked his tax advisors to figure out a way to change his
assessing officer back to what they were. Many say that these worries are
somewhat unfounded. ""Many companies have been approaching and making pleas of
changing their assessing officers, which is not possible. Every officer has
undergone training and there is no need to worry,"" a government official in
the know clarified.

""Most former VAT officials had until now dealt with indirect taxes on goods
and they would now be dealing with services. Although many of these officials
were given training, there would be a learning curve and this has worried
several services companies that have been assigned to state authorities,"" said
Sachin Menon, national head, indirect tax,

KPMG India

.

The worries may not be unfounded. Tax experts point out that indirect tax is a
complex subject. ""One of my clients, an IT firm, had received a notice because
the tax officer wanted a copy of an airfare receipt,"" he laughs. ""However, I
would say many officers would go easy on companies whose business models they
don't understand, and it may just be a good thing.""

But not everyone is convinced as some officers are already asking questions
which are making some companies jittery. Take the example of a law firm. The
tax officer wanted to know about each transaction leading to revenue of the
firm (although law firms are exempted from GST). The officer wanted to know
how come the head of the law firm was charging a fee of Rs 2 lakh for ""merely
talking for half an hour"" from a client, but not charging anything from
another client with whom she had spoken for two hours.

""It's not the law alone, the procedure of indirect taxes, especially GST, is
complex. It would have been great if officers who have no experience were
allotted smaller companies or firms for initial few years,"" a senior tax
advisor said.

  NEW DELHI: Apple wants the government to relax labelling rules so that it doesn't have to print product-related information directly onto devices to avoid cluttering up their minimalist design. That's one of the concessions Apple has sought after expressing its intention to start manufacturing in India, an official said.  

 

  The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) forwarded the iPhone maker’s request to the Department of Revenue and Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeITY) in November for consideration, said another official. The company manufactures its products in six countries, with most being made in China.  

 

  

 

 

  Apple's distinctive design language is integral to product appeal and it strives to keep surfaces as free of artefacts as possible. The company wants to provide the product details that are required by law in India as part of the software of the device or on the packaging. The labelling issue will be dealt with by DeITY, the official said.  

 

  The company has also sought tax incentives that are being examined by the finance ministry. The government currently provides subsidies for investments in special economic zones in order to woo investors. Apple did not respond to queries.  

 

  The finance ministry had rejected an earlier proposal by Apple to set up wholly owned outlets in the country that sought exemption from the compulsory 30% local sourcing norm. The company had sought the exemption on the grounds that it was bringing ""state-of-the-art"" and “cutting-edge technology,"" making it difficult to meet the sourcing condition.

**Fitch keeps India rating unchanged at BBB-, cites weak public finances** 

 ______ 
Fitch Rating (Representational Image) Fitch Rating (Representational Image)

Despite a continued pitch from the government and corporates for an upgrade, global rating agency Fitch Ratings has kept its sovereign rating on India unchanged, citing weak public finances. In its latest rating review, Fitch acknowledged India’s strong growth and recent economic reforms but maintained that the state of the government’s finances do not justify an upgrade. Fitch affirmed India’s sovereign rating at BBB-, the lowest investment grade rating. The outlook on India’s rating remains stable, with the agency saying that upside and downside risks to the sovereign rating are broadly balanced.

India’s long-term foreign and local-currency issuer default ratings were also at ‘BBB-’. “India’s sovereign ratings balance a strong medium-term growth outlook and favourable external balances with a weak fiscal position and difficult business environment. However, the business environment is likely to gradually improve with the implementation and continued broadening of the government’s structural reform agenda,” it said. On Monday, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh had said, “Why is India, the fastest growing emerging economy for over one year now with all macroeconomic fundamentals being positive, rated just BBB-? On the other hand, Italy and Spain, which are far weaker and smaller, are having much higher ratings than us.”

“Italian banks are in far worse shape than our banks. Italian government is more shaky and we have a solid political stability now,” he had said. According to Fitch, weak public finances continue to constrain India’s ratings, with a high general government debt burden of 67.9 per cent of GDP (‘BBB’ median: 40.9 per cent) and wide fiscal balance of -6.6 per cent of GDP as estimated by Fitch for FY17. However, there are some early indications that fiscal policy might become more focussed on bringing down debt, it said.

Fitch said India’s economy is less developed on a number of structural metrics than many of its peers. Average per capita GDP remains low at $1,714, compared with the ‘BBB’ range median of $9,701. Governance standards also remain weak, as illustrated by a low score for the World Bank governance indicator (46th percentile versus the ‘BBB’ median of 58th percentile).

An official committee reviewing the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act has recommended lowering government debt to 60 per cent of GDP. “It remains uncertain if the government will commit to the target suggested by the committee, but in his February 2017 budget speech, the finance minister explicitly recognised the low number of direct taxpayers, stating that India is “largely a tax non-compliant society”, which is a significant change in rhetoric. The central government’s FY18 budget also continues its gradual consolidation efforts irrespective of the difficult trade-off with the desire to spur infrastructure spending,” Fitch said.

“Significant contingent liabilities for the sovereign continue to emanate from public sector banks. The banking sector’s non-performing assets (NPAs) problem is well recognised by authorities, but continues to linger,” it said. Fitch expects NPAs to rise to 9.7 per cent of total loans by end-FY17, from 4.6 per cent in FY15, due mainly to stricter implementation of standards.

**Stand-up India: Key to developing entrepreneurs from underprivileged sections of society is mentoring** 

 ______ 
Lacking sufficient employment opportunities, India’s youth are turning to small and micro enterprises for livelihood.

Indian startups have captured global attention, attracted venture capital and achieved notable success in recent years. Such an effort if replicated at scale for underprivileged sections of society can have a catalytical impact on job generation in the country. While new entrepreneurship requires a supportive environment for finance and facilitative administrative procedures, creating large-scale entrepreneurship across the country additionally necessitates special measures for addressing capacity gaps among prospective entrepreneurs. Mentorship and effective links with financial institutions can play a key role in this endeavour.

Lacking sufficient employment opportunities, India’s youth are turning to small and micro enterprises for livelihood. According to the Sixth Economic Census conducted in 2013-14, there were about 58 million establishments in the country, employing some 130 million workers. Manufacturing, retail trade and livestock farming were the top three activities as per the Census. In addition, the shared economy fostered through online and telecom platforms too creates new opportunities for small and tiny businesses to generate rising income opportunities.

In the Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST), we have seen instructive examples of the impact that mentors can have on entrepreneurs from weaker sections of the society. Starting in 1992, BYST has helped establish 5,500 entrepreneurs through mentorship, creating about 2.5 lakh jobs. Tusshar Munoat from a poor farmer family of Maharashtra was identified as a potential entrepreneur, in one instance, and linked with a mentor who helped him to obtain finance for applying for government tenders in road construction. Munoat had maintained good accounting records and followed practices such as stock movement registers which made it easier to get the loan. With strict control on raw material quality and adherence to contractual conditions, he built lasting roads, providing employment to over 1,000 people from neighboring villages.

You may also like to watch:

Helping such young entrepreneurs convert their ideas into viable business enterprises under the guidance of mentors who double up as incubators for their new ventures can enable these job seekers become job creators. The new entrepreneurs need complete support and training, inspiration and networking and must be nurtured until they reach a level where they are not only self-sufficient, but in turn are able to do their bit for society by creating wealth and employment.

Mentors, too, should be selected carefully and trained with certification. Under the BYST program, each enterprise is assigned an individual mentor who provides personalised advice, tracks business growth and helps solve problems. Counselling and mentoring is needed right from product identification to scaling up and long-term growth.

Another example is of Bhaskar Tamuli from Assam, who wished to set up an enterprise to revive the traditional craft of bell metal. Lacking information on how to set up an enterprise, he needed counselling, training, and support to prepare the project report, and follow up with the financing bank. The designated mentor was able to work with Tamuli to obtain a loan and go on to maintain proper accounts, improve product design, link with markets lineage, manage employees, and conduct other essential business processes. This can have a cascading impact as well. Tamuli further encouraged 300 other persons to set up business, and is now considering exports. He has also ventured into training of local workers and has become a mentor himself.

Such handholding of entrepreneurs who lack the necessary knowledge is particularly important to encourage women entrepreneurship. Women face additional societal norms and family pressures which hinder their venturing into business. However, the micro-finance movement has demonstrated that they can be effective income-earners, given the right support.

Shanmugadevi Lakshmana Perumal conquered all odds to set up Swasti Support Services Pvt Ltd, which provides integrated facilities management services to corporates, IT Parks, hotels, etc. BYST helped in securing a loan from the Bharatiya Mahila Bank, Chennai. After the Chennai floods devastated her enterprise, more mentoring enabled her to stand on her feet again by launching a new brand logo, website and marketing collateral for ‘Vivikura’. Another inspirational example is of Archana Parmathayalan who started a catering enterprise providing food for boys living in hostels.Her mentor helped her streamline the processes, improve efficiency, maintain financial records, and undertake financial forecasting, even obtaining ISO certification in the process.

We have found that the mentors too derive high personal satisfaction in voluntarily assisting entrepreneurs in building new livelihood opportunities. The mentors tend to remain in the program and take several new enterprises to successful maturity without expectation of returns. BYST has a cadre of over 4,500 mentors who devote time, energy and expertise to ensure success for entrepreneurs from weaker sections of society.

Under the Government’s MUDRA Yojana, Startup India and other programs, entrepreneurship creation is receiving the same policy attention as job generation. However, the lack of formal training and absence of information on how to set up a business hampers this effort. With a mass mentoring movement and spread of incubation to rural India, we could see a flowering of entrepreneurship at all levels.

**‘The party will be over’: How GST will affect businesses that don’t pay tax** 

 ______ 
Rakesh Sachdeva sells auto parts in a busy market in central Delhi, just a few miles from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office. Yet despite having a flourishing business he does not pay any tax.

Until now, his rundown premises and small scale operation has kept the business below the radar of India’s tax officials. Come July 1, however, “the party will be over”, says the 51-year-old, with a resigned shrug.

A nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST), set to come into effect on Saturday, has faced criticism for its complex design. But the country’s biggest tax reform since independence is promising to bring millions of firms like Sachdeva’s into the tax net, boosting government revenues and India’s sovereign credit profile.

The new tax will require firms to upload their invoices every month to a portal that will match them with those of their suppliers or vendors.

Because a tax number is needed for a firm to claim a credit on the cost of its inputs, many companies are refusing to buy from unregistered businesses. Those who don’t sign up risk losing any customer who has.

“I have no option, but to register with the new system,” said Sachdeva, who spoke to Reuters on condition the name and precise location of his shop were not disclosed.

Boosting the coffers

Improved tax compliance should shore up public finances, augmenting resources for welfare and development spending and giving a lift to the $2 trillion economy.

India currently has one of the worst tax-to-GDP ratios among major economies at 16.6%, less the half the 34 percent average for the members of the OECD and also below many emerging economies.

While there is no official estimate of the potential fiscal gain, some tax experts say the measure, after the initial teething trouble, would lift the tax-to-GDP ratio by as much as 4 percentage points as the number of tax filers is estimated to more than treble to 30 million.

“In future, compliance is going to be extremely crucial,” Rajiv Nair, chief executive officer at Kaya Ltd., told Reuters. “Since we are also responsible for compliance across the supply chain, we have to ensure that the suppliers we have are in a position to work with us in a compliant manner.”

Nair’s company, which makes beauty and personal care products, has just streamlined its supply chain, dropping vendors that were not going to be GST-compliant.

Other companies are doing the same. Elior Group, a French catering and food service company, said it has mandated GST-compliance as one of the eligibility criteria for its orders.

A REVAMP 17 YEARS IN THE MAKING India is all set to keep its July 1 date with the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a reform that has been in the making for 17 years. GST will unify India into one market place with one uniform tax, shore up government revenue and is expected to spur economic growth. Timeline of the long journey to GST rollout:

Winners and losers

The unorganised sector of India’s economy is vast, employing an estimated nine out of 10 workers.

While staying outside the GST regime risks losing business, joining it will necessitate an overhaul of firms’ accounting systems and an investment in technology.

The new tax system requires three filing a month plus an annual return - a total of 37 filings - for each of India’s 29 states in which a firm operates. For smaller companies operating on wafer thin margins, hiring accountants and technical staff could substantially dent their bottom line.

Sanjiv Mehra, head of a traders’ body in Delhi, reckons a “prohibitive” cost could prove to be counterproductive.

“Compliance is needed for input tax credit,” he said. “But what if you are in a business where margins are strong and allows you to forsake credit?”

But despite its flaws, many analysts think the new tax will be good news for bigger established businesses, because it will sweep away an array of federal and state sales taxes, levied at different stages of the supply chain, that often result in double taxation.

The government estimates the GST will save companies around $14 billion because it will allow them to organise their warehouses and supply chains more efficiently.

Firms can now move to demand-based “hub-and-spoke” models used globally, rather than operating state-by-state.

“Those companies which can wring out the maximum cost efficiency are the ones investors should bet on,” said Ajay Bodke, head of portfolio management services at financial firm Prabhudas Lilladher in Mumbai. “All consumer-facing industries will be big beneficiaries of the GST.”

Didn't these firms have a sales tax number before?

Companies buying from them earlier would have surely shown whatever they purchased as expenses in their tax filing (I am not talking about tax credit, just expenses in a P & L statement). Now for showing these purchases as expenses, they would have needed a bill/receipt/invoice from these firms. For that these firms would need to have a Sales Tax Number.

**Au Small Finance Bank IPO; here’s what 8 brokerages say** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: AU Small Finance Bank is all set to hit the market with an initial public offering ( IPO ) on Wednesday. On offer are 53.42 million shares in the price band of Rs 355-358 apiece. The issue will close on Friday.The Jaipur-based company, which has got RBI licence to engage in small finance banking, has already commenced operations. With a network of 300 branches spread across Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Goa and Chhattisgarh, the lender used to serve across 10 states as a non-banking finance company ( NBFC ) – AU Financiers – before foraying into the small finance bank space.Here’s what brokerages said on the IPO:AU Small Finance Bank (AU SFB) is a small finance bank that recently transitioned from a retail-focused NBFC and primarily serves low and middle income individuals and businesses. Started in 1996, the company’s business primarily was focused on vehicle finance. The company later ventured into MSME and SME loans. AU SFB commenced business as a small finance bank on April 19, 2017. The transition to SFB has offered AU SFB significant growth potential and will help deliver improved performance and return ratios. At the upper band of the price band at Rs 358, the post-money valuation of AU SFB is at 5.3 times P/ABV FY17 of Rs 68, which we believe, leaves little scope for any upside in the near term. Hence we recommend investors to subscribe to the issue only with a long-term investment horizon.AU SFB’s gross AUM has grown at a CAGR of 30 per cent over FY13-17 on account of sectoral tail winds such as a financial inclusion drive and low credit penetration in certain areas of the country. These growth drivers are likely to persist over the longer term. As a result, AU SFB should continue its record high growth rate on its loan book.Further, AU SFB has successfully diversified its loan book composition that has helped it reduce concentration risk and improve asset quality. Out of the total loan book, 98.99 per cent is backed by revenue-generating assets. Also, LTVs of 80-85 per cent on showroom prices for vehicles loans and 40 per cent for MSME/SME loans are indicative of high-quality loan underwriting and risk management practices at AU SFB.Its initiation into housing finance and unsecured lending in FY18 should aid further diversification of the loan book. Given that the management has strong operational experience in housing finance and has an excellent track record of scaling up the same, we are confident that its initiation of housing finance will only add to profitable growth for AU SFB besides achieving diversification and risk management objectives. AU SFB has also displayed strong focus on optimising costs to keep profitability levels high. At the upper end of the price band of Rs 358, issue is priced at 5.1 times FY17 book value. Based on the management’s successful track-record of scaling up the business over the years, generating high returns (better RoAE than peers), focus on optimising costs, well-established framework for controlling asset quality and well-thought-out future expansion strategy, we recommend subscribe rating to long-term investors.In its earlier avatar as an NBFC, AU grew its gross loan assets and earnings at a robust CAGR of 34 per cent and 65 per cent, respectively, over FY14-17. The brisk AUM growth was complemented by its business diversity, both in terms of products and geographies. Profitability grew by leaps and bounds, notwithstanding persistent investments on the back of moderation in funding cost and firm control on product pricing.Post SFB launch, growth and profitability would be restricted; but the longer-run prospects seem bright. Its conversion into SFB will augment earnings diversity and stability. The IPO of 53.4 million shares is a 100 per cent offer for sale; with the promoters divesting 9 million shares after which they would bring down their holding to 33 per cent.At the upper end of the price band of Rs 355-358, the stock is being valued at 5.3 times FY17 P/ABV. In our view, this valuation, more than being palatable, offers a material upside post listing. We recommend a subscribe rating.While the trailing valuation of 5.1 times FY17 P/BV may look expensive after taking a first look, this is a unique model with no exact peers. An important distinguishing factor is that Au SFB is a small finance bank and can raise deposits to keep the cost of funds low, unlike its peers. Therefore, the SFB model should do better compared to the NBFC model in the long run.At the upper end of the price band, the company is valued at a P/BV of 5.1 times on FY17, which is relatively higher than the peer group NBFCs. However, given the consistent track record of AU delivering high growth, better RoAs with contained asset quality issues vs peers, AU commands a premium valuation. At the offered valuation, we recommend a subscribe rating on the issue with a long-term view.Given the strong presence in niche customer segments, AU SFB’s profitability will be remain superior to most conventional banks, said the brokerage. “Despite the migration to SFB, we estimate that AU will report trough RoEs of 17 per cent in FY18 this will recover to 20 per cent by FY20. This is significantly better than its listed peers which are currently reporting single digit RoEs. As such, valuations at 3.2 times book on FY20 are reasonable, and investors can expect strong upside over the next few years,” it said.Its evolution from a DSA of HDFC Bank to a significant retail lending NBFC and outstanding performance track record suggest AU SFB has the potential to emerge as one of the most successful SFBs in three to five years. “We expect AU SFB to attract higher valuation premium compared to its peers led by sustainability of high growth in diversified business amid lower assets quality risk. At the upper end of the price band at Rs 358, AU SFB’s market capitalisation would stand at Rs 102 billion, which gives it a price-to-book multiple of 5.1 times on March 2017 book value and P/E of 31.2 times on FY17 profit. We recommend subscribe rating to the issue, as it provides a favourable investment opportunity for long-term investors.At the upper end of the price band at Rs 358, the issue is offered at 5.1 times its FY2017 BV. However, AU has reported a strong 48 per cent PAT CAGR over FY2013-17. “We believe it has the potential to deliver 30 per cent PAT CAGR over FY2017-19. Based on our quick estimates on FY2019 BV, the issue is offered at 3.5 times. While the issue is offered at premium valuations, we believe the valuation is justified given the historical track record and strong growth potential that SFB offers. We recommend subscribe rating on the issue,” the brokerage said.

**RBI revises definition of what constitutes a bank branch** 

 ______ 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI), apart from reworking the definition of a bank branch, also widened the role of bank boards, making them responsible for complying with the new guidelines. Photo: Mint

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday relaxed the branch authorization policy, bringing all branches and fixed business correspondent outlets under the definition of banking outlets and removing restrictions on opening branches in Tier 1 centres.

According to the revised policy, RBI has defined “a banking outlet” for a scheduled commercial, a payments bank or a small finance bank as a fixed point service delivery unit, manned by either the bank’s staff or its business correspondent, where services of acceptance of deposits, encashment of cheques, cash withdrawal or lending of money are provided for a minimum of 4 hours per day for at least five days a week”. Those outlets which do not meet this criteria will be called “part-time banking outlet.”

While the policy has removed restrictions on opening banking outlets in Tier 1 to Tier 6 centres without taking RBI’s permission in each case, the regulator has mandated that banks open 25% of these outlets in unbanked rural centres (URC). Under the revised policy, a URC is defined as a “rural (Tier 5 and 6) centre that does not have a core banking system (CBS)-enabled ‘banking outlet’ of a scheduled commercial bank, a small finance bank, a payment bank or a regional rural bank nor a branch of local area bank or licensed co-operative bank for carrying out customer based banking transactions”.

With the expansion in definition of a branch, RBI has allowed all extension counters, satellite offices, part-shifted branches, ultra small branches and specialized branches, to be treated as ‘banking outlets’ or ‘part-time banking outlets’. However, ATMs, E-lobbies, bunch note acceptor machines ,cash deposit machines, e- kiosks and mobile branches will fall outside the purview of “banking outlets”. This is a shift from the earlier definition of a “branch” which also included off-site ATMs.

The proposal to rationalise the branch authorization policy was introduced under former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan in the April 2016 monetary policy. “With a view to facilitating financial inclusion and providing flexibility on the choice of delivery channel, it is proposed to redefine branches and permissible methods of outreach, keeping in mind the various attributes of the banks and the types of services that are sought to be provided,” RBI had said in the policy statement.

Later an internal working group was set up, which came out with the draft report in October 2016. The key focus of the recommendations was to facilitate financial inclusion by ensuring availability of banking services in all centers through low-cost delivery channels.

The revised policy has also allowed small finance banks three years from the date of commencement of business to align their banking network with the extant guidelines. Till such time, the existing structures may continue and would be treated as “banking outlets” though not immediately reckoning for the 25% norm. “Nevertheless, during this period of three years, for all the banking outlets opened or converted from the existing MFI branches in a year, they will have to open 25% banking outlets in unbanked rural centres in the same year,” RBI said.

“This policy will help in further penetration in rural areas and increase the profitability of the organization. We expect 10-15% more growth in the business with same set of branches we have projected,” said Munish Jain, chief operating officer of Capital Small Finance Bank.

**Regulatory reform fails to cut red tape: NITI Aayog** 

 ______ 
The survey conducted by NITI Aayog and IDFC Institute reveals that the experience of regulatory reform has not been uniform across the country. Graphic: Mint

New Delhi: The big push by central and state governments to ease the regulatory environment notwithstanding, the perception of most business enterprises is that little has changed on the ground, a new survey has found.

The nationwide survey of the organized manufacturing sector was conducted jointly by the NITI Aayog and IDFC Institute, a Mumbai-based think tank, to monitor the business environment in the country. It surveyed 3,276 enterprises, including 141 early-stage firms, across 23 categories.

Not only do the survey results serve as a wake-up call to the government and a reminder that the legacy of red tape is far more difficult to undo than what has been thought so far, it also reveals that the experience of regulatory reform has not been uniform across the country.

The results released on Monday showed that for a majority of respondents, parameters such as setting up a business, land and construction, environment, labour, water and sanitation, taxes, and access to finance remained the same compared with a year ago; on legal matters, they reported that things had worsened. The survey was conducted in 2016.

To be sure, a little over a third of the respondents did say that there was an improvement in ease of doing business, while about a fifth said procedures had deteriorated.

While 38% of the enterprises said that the regulatory environment for setting up a business had improved, the same proportion claimed nothing had changed and 21% said it had worsened. A large proportion (44%) of the enterprises said the regulatory framework for getting environment clearances had stayed the same while only 17% said it had worsened. Around 36% of the enterprises said that legal processes for resolving disputes had worsened while only 25% said they had improved. About 46% of enterprises said that access to finance had stayed the same while 36% said it had improved.

The World Bank, in its Doing Business survey report released last year, offered a plausible explanation. “The experience of implementing reforms based on doing business data has demonstrated to the government the significance of establishing clear stakeholder feedback mechanisms to close the gaps between policy formulation and implementation,” it said.

India’s ranking in the World Bank’s annual Doing Business survey improved by just one notch to 130 in its 2017 report from a revised rank of 131 last year. India is targeting a 40-notch jump in ranking in the upcoming survey, which is expected to be released in October.

The NITI Aayog-IDFC Institute survey also found that a substantial chunk of the enterprises surveyed were not aware of many of the improvements undertaken both by the Union and state governments.

On average, only about 20% of manufacturing start-ups were using the single-window facilities introduced by state governments for setting up a business. Even among experts, only 41% had any knowledge of the existence of these facilities. “Therefore, there is a clear need for creating greater awareness. In cases in which the lack of use is due to poor functioning of the service, the functioning must be improved,” the survey recommended.

Conceding that there was a communication gap, a person involved in overseeing the survey said that “every single company needs to be told about the changes taking place”.

Based on the results, the survey recommends more flexible labour laws to allow businesses to gain economies of scale. It also makes a strong case for states to open up their power distribution sector to private competition to lower costs and improve reliability.

Some analysts disagreed with the findings, claiming that the business climate has actually improved. “The robust inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) despite volatile global macroeconomic situation reflects the overall improvement in ease of doing business in India,” said N.R. Bhanumurthy, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a think tank.

FDI inflow in the April-June quarter jumped 37% to $10.7 billion compared with $7.6 billion received in the same period a year ago.

Commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who released the survey along with information and technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, said improving ease of doing business is getting the central government’s full attention.

**Banks wary of Modi government's merger plan for fear of loss of brand name** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The government is looking at consolidation of at least two state-run banks in this financial year, but some of the lenders identified for merger or takeover by bigger entities have expressed serious reservations on their identities being subsumed in the process.The target banks are keen that their names survive the consolidation and they continue to have a strong role in business operations, officials said. Earlier this year, four state-run banks – Syndicate Bank, Canara Bank, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank – made presentations to the finance ministry on their consolidation plans.“We have worked out some combinations. This involves a larger bank taking over two smaller entities.Also, there is a case for merging two smaller but strong banks. We can look at some hybrid names which retain characters of the both banks,” said a government official, who did not wish to be identified.The official cited the case of the merger between Centurion Bank and Bank of Punjab that led to the creation of a new entity, Centurion Bank of Punjab, which later merged with HDFC Bank in 2008.Senior executives of the banks being considered for consolidation have told the finance ministry that the brand names of the lenders have deep-rooted association with their borrowers and the loss of brand names could potentially affect business. Vijaya Bank, for instance, was set up in 1931. Syndicate Bank, set up in 1925, was earlier known as Canara Industrial and Banking Syndicate Ltd.Experts, however, said the merger exercise should not be delayed only because of brand issues.“These are state-run lenders. The borrowers are aware of this and there is no possibility of losing business just because a lender reinvented its brand name,” said MP Shorawala, a former independent director with Central Bank of India. “We already have a successful example in case of Axis Bank.”In 2007, UTI Bank rechristened itself as Axis Bank. “The idea was to get a grasp on the issues which could come up during the merger exercise,” the official cited earlier said, adding that some of the factors taken into consideration for merger are the business mix, the information technology platform that the banks are operating on and the geographical spread.In April, State Bank of India absorbed five of its associate lenders and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, creating a larger bank that accounts for a quarter of all outstanding loans. There are 21 state-run banks in India.In June, after reviewing the quarterly performance of public sector banks, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the government was “actively working” towards consolidation but did not share any details, stating this was price-sensitive information.The government is also undertaking a simultaneous exercise to assess the capital requirements of state-run banks. “We are waiting for the first quarter results.Once that happens, we will allocate further capital based on their requirements,” Jaitley had said at the time.While the government has already allocated Rs 8,000 crore — the spillover from the previous fiscal, this year, it plans to provide another Rs 10,000 crore by way of capital infusion.

I appreciate OP who wants to learn all he can. To all other users who feel they are similar to OP, you can do this two ways:  
1. Crib and complain you don't know anything  
2. Take the initiative, start learning yourself.

Khan Academy's links to understanding basic money concepts: https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance


Edited to add: Read the big financial newspapers in the country: Economic Times, Business Standard, Financial Express, The Hindu Business Line. All have decent websites. XI and XII class ki business studies and economics ki book padh lo. if you are interested in learning all aspects of personal finance then visit the faq section of /r/IndiaInvestments 

Also check the articles on sites like www.jagoinvestor.com

They also offer services http://www.jagoinvestor.com/services which are more of educating you rather than providing a off the shelf service
 On a serious note, whether we learn German or Sanskrit, some of the basic finance topics consumer banking, tax, investments should be taught in schools or colleges so as to not get ripped.

Let girls alone, guys don't know enough about these things. And, things are complicated and I would want FM to simplify these things.  Try coursera.org for a free online course on Macro Economics. Try to correlate what you are learning with stuff in the newspapers. Also go to a CA and file your tax yourself with him helping you. The more you do stuff on your own, the more it'll make sense... its not that hard, just a bit daunting. Khan academy

not really indian context, but overall good resource for Finance/Banking 101 So disappointed with this thread! Really thought I'll get better answers than taking courses and reading textbooks. 

I feel the same way as you OP. I just don't know how to manage money and my biggest nightmare is that someone will cheat me out of it because I am too naive. Currently I get more than 5 calls per week asking me to invest in FDs at my bank. I have no idea about interest rates, I didnt even know my current balance earns an interest. I'd like some ""smart"" folk here to explain where I could invest my savings in a super simple but efficient way. I aint got no time to read my high school economics textbooks again. Seriously I don't remember a thing although I aced it. ;)

Recently I had to file taxes at my company and realised my parents have manipulated my name in not having a single thing to claim tax. I just sat down and wondered wtf is happening. Needless to say I couldn't claim. I have a pan card but it was handed to me by my dad who got it all done. So no fucking idea what happened there. 

I request someone here to tell me brielfly about things I discussed. (no links) thankyou! Search for business insider 25 most useful websites.1 site among that list teaches finance. Also add Taxation ,shares ,investment etc :) TTC lectures money and banking(paid)


Khan academy > To be more clear, I am a medical student

Consider finances and investing as a complex system (like the human body). Like for a healthy life, you don't *need* to understand the intricacies of the workings of the human body, similarly for good financial management and investing, you don't need to understand how and why of all those changes. 

> I don't know how or why the rates of oil, gold and the value of money changes, 

Most people, including investors, don't understand the reasons of those either. Don't go by the financial news networks explanations ex post facto. 

For the modern monetary system working, check out [this research article](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1905625). This is posted in terms of the US system, but applies on India too. 

> how the bank works 

Banks take money from the depositors (as money in the savings and current accounts, FD, etc) and lend them to those who need it. In the middle of this, they have their margin. Eg, the highest FD rates would be 8-9% while the lowest lending rates would be 11-13% (so the gap of 3-4% is their profit margin). This is the most basic idea.

The Indian pharmaceutical and healthcare industry has long been dominated by men, a trait it shares with many of its counterparts abroad. But now a big change is sweeping across this immensely technical and challenging business landscape. A new crop of women business leaders has emerged at the top, coming up with game-changing ideas and services in some of India's top pharma and healthcare companies. Their business acumen apart, these women have added tremendous value in shaping their organisations.
 
 They are reinventing age-old practices and promoting diversity to meet challenges and take their companies to the top. Some like Ameera Shah of Metropolis have built the business from scratch while others like Samina Vaziralli of Cipla have been handed the reins of a 75-year-old company. But whether it is building businesses or wading through troubled waters, they have proved their mettle. They are young, but have come of age quickly. They are not afraid of taking business risks or foraying into newer businesses. They have embedded a culture of inclusive environment and pushed for HR reforms targetted at women in the DNA of their companies — who better than them to understand the struggles of juggling family and business. These are their stories.
 
 Our systems have kept pace with growth: Namita Thapar 39 CFO, Emcure Pharmaceuticals
 Key Accomplishment: Expanding global footprint and making five global acquisitions in the past 3-4 year
 Key Challenge: Managing work-life balance. Having to earn the respect from peers who judge her as someone born with a silver spoon 
 
 In 2006, five years after she completed her MBA from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, Namita Thapar got a call from her father Satish Mehta, promoter and CEO of Emcure Pharmaceuticals, to join the family business in Pune. Thapar, a CA by qualification was then working in the healthcare sector in the US — for Glaxo and Guidant (now Abbott) in various finance roles. Emcure had by then received funding from private equity fund Blackstone and had aggressive plans to enter the US market. Mehta felt that with his daughter's US education and experience in the healthcare sector would add value to the business. He persuaded her and her husband to move back to India.
 
 The move paid off. Emcure is one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical companies in India on account of launch of innovative formulations developed by its R&D and marketing strategies designed to build brands. In the last 10 years, it has grown from a Rs 500 crore company to a Rs 4,500 crore entity. ""I can't take all the credit as my brother Samit and husband Vik have added tremendous value too, but believe I have made some good changes based on my experience in the US. All three of us got a lot of autonomy from my father to make changes,"" says Thapar.
 
 Emcure has made five large global acquisitions in the past three years. As CFO, Thapar and her team assisted the M&A team in those deals. ""These strategic acquisitions have significantly expanded our global footprint,"" says Thapar.
 
 At Emcure, Thapar has brought more automation in finance, was closely involved with domestic marketing and helped make meetings more data driven (especially through sales force automation). She also worked with HR to improve critical systems such as appraisal, variable compensation and talent identification. ""I am a strong believer that as a company scales, it needs to become more process driven and develop leadership bandwidth,"" she adds.
 
 Thapar says there are plenty of reasons for more women to join the pharma sector. Functions like quality, finance, marketing, IT, regulatory are great areas for women to work, according to her.
 
 She has launched a program called ""Prerna"" aimed at increasing the representation of women in the company, which has doubled to 20 per cent in the past four years. Emcure has several women in leadership roles in quality, regulatory, marketing, IT, HR and finance, says Thapar.

Blockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did, said Lula Mohanty, managing partner of IBM Global Business Services. Photo: Reuters

Mumbai: The Mahindra Group and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) will co-develop a blockchain solution, which the companies claim, has the potential to reinvent supply chain finance across India by enhancing security, transparency and operational processes.

This cloud-based application, one of the first projects of its kind in India outside of traditional banking, is designed to transform supplier-to-manufacturer trade finance transactions, Mahindra said in a statement.

The blockchain-based supply chain finance solution will enable all parties involved in the transaction to act on the same shared ledger, with each party updating only its part of the process, ensuring efficiency, consistency, trust and transparency, while safeguarding sensitive information.

Invoice discounting, the process of bundling and selling invoices at a discount, is a major source of working capital finance for many suppliers. This new solution aims to enable more suppliers to access credit, with the goal of driving more financial inclusion throughout the supply chain. The solution aims to simplify supplier-to-manufacturer invoice discounting processes that have historically been difficult, slow and risky, requiring each party to maintain and manually update separate ledgers.

Anish Shah, group president (strategy), Mahindra Group, said the group is pioneering the use of blockchain to disrupt its traditional businesses and drive future growth.

The company is also actively looking at other applications across the group in financial services, auto, mobility and agritech. “This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance’s small and mid-sized enterprises loans business. Working with IBM, we will work to build, test, scale and refine this solution over time,” said Shah.

Blockchain technology can help enable Mahindra Finance access transactions recorded on a shared ledger in near real-time, enabling it to develop and offer new products to small and mid-sized enterprises. This is a radical process and technology shift which has the potential to drive business growth into the future.

“Blockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did,” said Lula Mohanty, managing partner of IBM Global Business Services.

The work with Mahindra has the potential to fundamentally transform the way businesses interact with one another and their customers and suppliers, “and we’re confident that this engagement can be replicated not just in the finance industry but across other sectors as well,” he said.

In an interview with Mint in June 2016, Shah said Mahindra is sharpening its focus on digital technologies such as blockchain, Big Data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and even augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), to boost growth.

646,Business/Finance,"I think your best option would be to opt for an MBA overseas.  If you want to expand your business, work with your dad and join an entrepreneur/Family Business oriented MBA/PGP program. For example, ISB has one http://www.isb.edu/management-programme-for-family-business.

 IMHO, you should go ahead with the MBA. Reasons:

1. It would give you the skillset and network needed to successfully run your dad's business, esp considering that you do not have work ex so far.

2. Even if you plan to stick with finance with the CFA, the MBA will still be a value add as it is highly regarded in finance companies.

A word of advice: Aim high, don't compromise on college because of the high fees. It's not like undergrad, where you can sit in your room at night and catch up on studies even if your profs are no good. In an MBA brand value and peer learning are important. Plus a top tier programme will provide enough return on investment to justify taking an education loan. Instead of CFA or MBA, why don't you try other finance courses too? You can learn with industry experts at Imarticus Learning. They even have placement options, if that is something you are interested in. Visit their website: www.imarticus.org .. They also offer online courses in case you want that flexibility. ",1438098170.0,1,9,0,6,"Currently, I am a undergrad student majoring in Finance in Thailand. I will be done in December.

I have no prior knowledge about the business and I will move to India to train myself (it has been taken care of).

I am considering an option and would like an opinion on this matter. I was thinking that while I learn my family business under someone else’s guidance, I also prepare myself for CFA. Since I am already a Finance undergrad, I will be furthering my studies in my field of interest. This would mean I can learn about how to handle a business and earn a CFA (provided I pass). But this would also mean boycotting the MBA.

Also, maybe pursue a Gemological Institute of America (GIA) course at some point – although unlikely.

How do you think of my plan? Will it be wise to not pursue MBA? I am uncertain if this is the right way to go and would love to have opinions. ",Should I get an MBA? [NP]

With cash shortages showing no signs of abating, economists are calling for emergency stimulus to cushion the economy against the impact of demonetisation. Photo: Mint

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s crackdown on the cash economy has shattered the consensus needed for a new national sales tax, plunging his boldest reform into limbo and threatening to entrench an economic slowdown.

Modi’s government already had its work cut out to finalise a deal with India’s 29 federal states to launch a goods and services tax (GST) on 1 April that would transform Asia’s third-largest economy into a single market for the first time.

But his decision to scrap 86% of the cash in circulation, in a bid to purge the economy of “black money”, has caused huge disruption.

A slump in business activity stemming from the cash crunch has caused the revenue of state governments, which collect value-added tax on goods and other duties, to slump by 25-40%.

The states won’t risk another setback by rushing the sales tax into force.

“The investment and economic environment in the country is in bad shape,” said West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra, who earlier head a panel tasked with building a consensus on the GST. “How is the country going to absorb the dual shock of GST and demonetisation?”

The GST is India’s biggest tax overhaul since independence in 1947. It would replace a plethora of federal and state levies with one tax, easing compliance, broadening the revenue base and boosting productivity.

It took Modi more than two years to forge a political compromise on the tax in August. Now, demonetisation “has created a trust deficit,” said Kerala finance minister TM Thomas Isaac. “After this, I am not going to sit and compromise. They don’t deserve it.”

Left in the lurch

Failure to break the deadlock could tip India into a fiscal crisis: The GST would need to come into effect by mid-September, when the old system of indirect taxation is due to lapse. The lingering uncertainty is worrying companies needing to understand financial implications of the new tax.

“With so many vital details still missing, they are feeling left in the lurch,” said Saloni Roy, a senior director at Deloitte.

Modi’s shock move last month to scrap Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes was aimed at India’s shadow economy. But the ensuing cash crunch has caused job losses, disrupted supply chains and slowed construction activity.

With cash shortages showing no signs of abating, some economists are calling for emergency stimulus to cushion the economy against the impact of demonetisation.

Ambit Capital, a Mumbai brokerage, forecasts growth this fiscal year will be only half of the roughly 7% level many expect. The Reserve Bank of India has shaved its growth outlook by half a percentage point to 7.1%.

To make up for their losses, states are seeking compensation and will press their case at a meeting in New Delhi on Thursday and Friday with finance minister Arun Jaitley.

He has already agreed to cover states’ revenue losses for five years after the GST’s launch, but further concessions would narrow his room for manoeuvre in his annual budget presented in February.

One top finance ministry official dismissed demands for compensation for demonetisation as unreasonable. But states are adamant. “They have brought it upon us,” V. Narayanasamy, chief minister of Puducherry, told Reuters. “Now they must pay for our loss.”

Counting costs

The quibble is not just over lost revenue. Some states worry about the social and political costs of demonetisation.

Take Kerala, where credit cooperatives that farmers and retired government workers rely on cannot swap old bills or issue fresh notes. The state alleges this has encouraged commercial banks to scout for their deposits, sparking a “run” on them.

Odisha’s chief minister has written to Modi, saying curbs imposed on primary agriculture societies were making it difficult for farmers to access crop loans and procurement payments.

With the states smarting, they have hardened their stance on how to collect the new GST, which will have federal and state elements.

They want sole control over businesses with annual turnover of Rs15 million ($220,000) and so-called “dual control” over bigger firms. Jaitley opposes this, fearing tax collectors could end up at cross purposes.

“We reached this far because states were willing to compromise,” said Isaac, Kerala’s finance minister, told Reuters. “If they want the GST, they will have to now concede to the states.” Reuters

> * Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) Arvind Subramanian has suggested Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to radically alter India's climate-change policy and negotiation strategy before the new global climate-change agreement, to be finalised in Paris by December this year.In a note to the two ministers - which has been reviewed by Business Standard - Subramanian has recommended that India should stop insisting that the developed countries provide financing for poor countries to fight climate change, as they are required to under the UN climate convention.The chief economic advisor has said India should align with coal-rich countries and distance itself from poor and developing countries, as well as existing allies like China, those in the BASIC grouping, other 'like-minded developing countries', and BRICS, for the coming climate change negotiations in Paris.He has advised that India stop focusing on adaptation to meet the inevitable threats of climate change on the poor and, instead, do more to reduce its own emission.

> * He has also suggested that India stop insisting that the current way of differentiating in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change between rich and developing countries - called annexures - be retained in future.Subramanian has warned that India should not trust China, even as the latter has formally insisted at the talks that this firewall be retained.So far, India's stance on climate-change negotiations has consistently been just the opposite, for years.

> * The present note elaborates the same observations, and additionally gives specific recommendations to the prime minister and finance minister on how India's goals, strategy and actions for the Paris talks should change.These recommendations, if accepted, will entail a complete overhaul of India's long-standing policy on climate change, internationally as well as domestically.

> * ""Seeking climate change financing, retaining the distinction between Annexe I (developed) and non-Annexe I (developing) countries, and emphasising on adaptation"" he has listed as ""less vital interests"" of the country.In a paragraph on why India should not demand climate change finance from rich countries, Subramanian has asked: ""Are the commitments of cash-strapped advanced countries plausible?

Edit : I know its the nominal figure, but it is calculated on the basis of inflation target of 4 % which in turn depends on the success of RBI and Govt policy in reviving industrial growth in the country. 8% real growth is still a massive challenge and using an inflated figure to claim that fiscal deficit will be brought down to 3.3% of estimated gdp figure for 2019-20 still implies that the fiscal deficit will rise in rupee term.

Please believe in Narendra Modi. The way he is guiding our economy, I'm sure you'll be eligible for benefits available to poor people within next 3-4 years! Corporate tax on companies with turnover up to ₹400 crore reduced to 25%.

Let me get this straight: Employer who has 400 crores of revenue gets taxed at 25%. Same employee of that employer may have to pay more than 30%.

Awesome. The budget lacked action. It had few proposals but majority of it was creating a vision for India. No big schemes or proposals So for people who want a comparison of how this budget is VS something from the MMS team, here’s chidabaram presenting the 2007 budget - http://www.moneycontrol.com/budget2007/pre_budget/Union%20Budget%202004-05.pdf?classic=true

I find that while he also says “there’s a plan for that”, he backed up more of his ideas with mechanisms of actions, cut offs to identify target groups, and specific budget allocations - at least compared to what I have seen so far by 12:10 IST. 

Let’s see how things change, and hope to be pleasantly surprised.

Edit: at least the banking section is more on the ball. However I’m not sure how RBI power over NBFCs is going to fix it?

Edit: hahaha! It’s here! Debt raising!! This is the govt of spend (not a bad thing provided it’s accretive) 


What It’s now time for our citizens duties! Is our duty to make sure we get the bang for our buck? 

Ok time for taxes.

Edit: Republican Party of India. Spend more, tax less, take on more debt, and reduce the fiscal deficit. 

Frankly, given the mess we have, even that contradictory plan is not bad. Government spending is now a major part of our teetering economy. At least that’s keeping the infra side of our economy thriving.

However someone has to pay, and with lower taxes, taking loans is the other option.

Edit: the tax credit on interest is Decent. Doesn't budget usually takes place around February, why now? Since the budget is presented in English, for the MP's who can't understand English do they have translators who translate the speach in real time? No disinvestment in Air India She's pronouncing Tamil like she did Hindi. Rajaji would've been proud! Can anyone link me a good website or video to learn about tax?

In that subsidized implements for solar power provided to farmers, who can sell it to power distributors via grid connection It looks like parliament is crowded and everyone is sitting in each other and it's making me uncomfortable. Aadhar and PAN to be interchangeable.   

Where you need PAN, you can just use Aadhar Card. Why is the minister speaking like this is an election campaign? Is every budget like this? Economic survey showed that rajasthan which relaxed the draconian labor laws generated about 25% more jobs than other states.

The current labor laws force small scale companies to not hire more than 99 employees.

This is because, as soon as you reach 100 employees, a large number of government laws and regulations come into effect.

This has caused small companies to not have any incentive to increase in size and take advantage of scaling to reduce costs Wow their arms are going to break with all the patting their own backs.

Literally zero hard numbers so far. This is disappointing in its predictability. What time (IST) will it start? What all reforms are you expecting? I’m expecting this budget to be something exciting this time. Will sadhvi also contribute to Gandhipedia which the minister is taking about? Did I miss the memo about Lord Basaveshwara? Nhb ko last saal pura 100% govt kia. Fir dekha gaunutra se kaam nahi baan raha. Send it back to RBI This just in: Taxpayers are the elephant in the room Fiscal deficit of 3.3% is starting to get into the high territory.

During the NDA 1 tenure, vajpayee government had made it a law to bring down fiscal deficit to 2% in 1 decade.

However both Congress and bjp government have shat on it every year without showing any serious intent to cut deficit.

We are not in a full blown recession yet so deficit should be cut more ""renewable"", ""carbon footprint"", ""environment"" being repeated many times, nice Car Sasti hogi kya?

\* senior citizens got tax sops  last year. so nothing new this time.  
\* some more sops to PSU banks.  
\* not a mention about money-sucking blackhole vaccums aka AirIndia, BSNL, MTNL, etc.  coz they'll continue to receive taxpayer money.  
\* RBI will be forced to give a few lakh crores to the govt.  
\* more steps towards namesake UBI. namesake coz: [a] it won't be universal. [b] existing subsidies will not be dismantled. [c] it'll be basically cash-for-votes

I see that there is an existing master thread on the Budget. I should have ideally posted this summary there. What is PIS and FPI? \> A TV channel for startups (to be designed by startups)

Let's hope it's just not another startup news channel, 'X startup secured Y funding' is useless for 99.9% of startups.

Where as UGC type startup channel which covers knowledge rather than information i.e. 'How to identify a problem, to solve with a startup', 'How to make money with a startup', 'How to improve capital efficiency' etc. would actually be useful. What's the tax slab for hybrid vehicles going to be? Still the retarded 28+cess?

Also if this is a provision in the budget and not a rate set by the GST council, is it constitutional? If it is, then wouldn't it then become a statutory provision that the GST council cannot amend? Who will prevail? Thanku for this. ",1562318518.0,1,7,0,75,"Highlights from the Budget Speech

Thanks u/SriNiveshIndia",What are your initial /thoughts reactions to the Union Budget 2019?
665,Business/Finance,"There are multiple factors involved.

Firstly NBFCs model is flawed. They borrow short term say 6 months to a year and lend Long term say 3-5 years.
Because of this they have to constantly keep raising funds.

Dhfl crisis happened because of poor liquidity on Dhfl part as they have some 20% exposure in bad performing real estate firms. But the Main cause of crisis is because of IL&FS. They had mismanagement of funds by senior managers of their subsidiaries because of which they defaulted on emis and the crisis began.

Now Dhfl wanted to raise funds because their short term borrowings were maturing but mutual funds as well as share market was pulling money from nbfcs as they deemed it too risky because of IL&FS. Because of this Dhfl was forced to borrow funds at very high interest.

This is the jist of it there is more to this. I recommend watching finnovationz video on this topic. NSDL crashed before? Then there is that Cobrapost expose as well. Something is shady at DHFL. ",1559105893.0,1,9,0,23,"ELI5 the crisis at Dewan Housing Finance ?  

i see news that DHFL isn't repaying depositors. [ref1](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/dhfl-stops-fixed-deposit-withdrawals-should-you-avoid-all-company-fds-4026751.html) , [ref2](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/dhfl-not-to-accept-deposits-or-allow-premature-withdrawals/articleshow/69437854.cms)    

further, there's some look out notice issued against DHFL promoters.

also, DHFL's stock price has been going down steep the past year.   

&nbsp;  

1. what exactly is the problem at DHFL?  
1. are they seeing poor loan repayments by home loan borrowers?  
1. is this the canary-in-coalmine   situation for a wider home-loan / real estate crash in India ?  
1. what causes led to this situation?   
1. did DHFL lend too aggressively / to 'sub prime' borrowers?  
1. what other lenders did similar practices , and are likely to face similar situation?  
1. is there any link between ILFS situation and DHFL ?  
1. if DHFL crashes (like ~~NSDL~~ NSEL, Giranjali gems, Kingfisher, etc) what would be the wider consequences? would their retail home-loan borrowers still need to continue paying EMIs after the lender company is liquidated / closed? (kek)    
1. from whom has DHFL borrowed money? what would be that lender's impact?  
1. are real-estate builders impacted in any manner due to this?  
* would this be yet another case of ""socialise the losses"" and hence some govt company (LIC esp) rescuing DHFL ?",ELI5 : the crisis at Dewan Housing Finance ?

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/jet-airways-timeline-when-and-what-happened-so-far-3846461.html Totally sad about jet airways leaving the scene. It was great service. It was also that one flight where tall people didn't need to pay more good leg room. The good days are gone. Miserly attitudes of India’s much famed middle class unwilling to pay for services, management issues, banks cracking down on companies run by truant owners, slowdown in the Indian economy etc. My few experiences on Jet have always been good. I hope they get operational with a new management soon. It employs a lot of people. Also the demand for air travel in India is only going to increase so Jet will leave a huge void in this sector. Yeah, it was a cheap flight and didn't feel as budget as Indigo or SpiceJet. Good service and great air hostesesseseses too. Will be missed. Yeah I've had a great time on Jet Airways as well.

I've only travelled by Jet , Indigo as of now.  
Had a much better time at Jet. On Jet, I was served free (and actually quite good) food. I got nothing on indigo. The airhostesses (guy and girl) seemed much much better on jet.  

At the airport itself, had a much better time with jet, than with Indigo. Not sure about others, or if I was in a special situation or anything, but yeah, I had a much better time on Jet than with Indigo.

(Travel experience : 1 round trip with jet, and another round trip with Indigo) Had a few memorable flights with jet.

Flew with jet when jet and air India was only premium offering...

Hated traveling by spice or go or indigo...

Always got middle seat empty on my sector.

Decently priced.

International circuit was good. Service was decent ( nothing too much, just enough)...

In a race with air india, it was indeed good.

As for other international carriers, it wasn't good. Nope. I only had one good experience in 2006 where i was served some decent meal and a fresh towel to wipe my face.

After the luxury of Kingfisher in it's heyday, jet always seemed over hyped and overpriced. 

Flew on their international flights last year, and it felt like i was flying Air India. Rubbish food, sparing cabin service and visibly aging aircraft. Bad situation for the employees very average airline in terms of flying experience. I didn't see the point of paying extra compared to indigo/spicejet for the almost same service. I had a jet airways flight in the morning, now I have no idea if/when I will get my money back. What are my options? I booked it through PayTM. 

What's worse is that I HAD to be where I needed to be and ended up booking a much more expensive flight. Fucking sucks. Talking about YYZ-BOM sector, looks like I am down $4000 because Jet shut down.

Today has been an absolutely awful day because of that. :(

Edit: I had booked 3 family members on AMD-BOM-YYZ return trips and I don't think I'll ever see that money. I was even thinking getting business class for one of the tickets (my grandmother). That would've been another $2000 down lol. At least I have that going for me, which is nice 3 months ago I flew jet airways from Paris chennai and back to Paris. Worst flight, service experience for an international flight. At that time itself I complained to their customer service. Sorry to say this.  I’m glad they’re out of business. I’ve flown many international airlines and this was the worst of it all. Lost all my JP miles :( ",1555522797.0,1,36,0,78,"I am surprised to see absence of Jet Airways closure in my r/india feed.

I flew on their BOM-AMD/BDQ leg couple of times and was very impressed by their customer service. They did a pretty good job in transferring international travellers to domestic route including luggage transfer. Also, as an international traveler, I was served hot delicious breakfast even on a 45 minutes flight, which was perhaps the best way to welcome back an NRI

Never got a chance to fly on their YYZ-BOM leg. Will always be a pipe dream.

Jet airways closure will be an interesting case for MBA finance students, and a reminder to all people - Always pay your bills on time!

PS. - The online newspaper articles doesn't explain why Jet Airways ran out of money despite doing good business. Can anyone care to elaborate?",Mourning the demise (?) of Jet Airways

https://penguin.co.in/book/uncategorized/the-verdict/ Thank you for making the list, OP.  A forthcoming book that looks interesting as well is Ruchir Sharma's Democracy on the Road (Penguin) but I haven't read that as yet.  Thanks for the list OP.

Also off topic, but can someone recommend a book that summarises the Constituent Assembly Debates about what went into making the constitution? mandatory mention of India After Gandhi, which covers the first election (and some important subsequent elections) I'd add Ruchir Sharma's **Democracy on the Road: A 25 Year Journey through India** to this list. 

From the 1990s to December 2018, he and journalist/analyst friends of his basically take road trips to most Indian states to see state and general election campaigns. It cites many of the academics listed in this thread, but it's a book for everyone and each chapter covers a different election. Quite funny/eye-opening/shocking at various points, as  they talk to everyone from Maoists to RSS to swing voters. They also talk to basically every major politician of the last 2 decades while on the campaign trail.

Shahni's book is a fascinating historical account of how the first electoral rolls in India were prepared. This is a process that is so technical and bureacratic that we don't always stop to consider how this laid the foundation for our democracy today. She uses archival materials to bring out how people struggled to gain the fundamental democratic right to vote in our first elections, and how this struggle informed the Constitution-making process.

Through interviews in a number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, she asks ordinary voters why they vote, what they think of politics and elections, and what drives them to participate in the democratic process.

673,Business/Finance,I've always liked the forest cover model of assigning tax resources to the States. It's a very esteemable initiative. [deleted] Summary  ,1552275567.0,1,3,0,6,"You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

674,Business/Finance,"Chill dude, no need to worry. It's better to be alone than with someone with whom you're not comfortable. Living by yourself has its own advantage.  * You have time. 30 is not that old. Get back out there when you are ready.
* Don't blame yourself, or your ex. If you wanted different things in life and had strong convictions about your choices, either one of you would have had to compromise and deal with the resentment that typically follows compromising core beliefs or the relationship would have fallen apart at some point if neither one wants to compromise. 
* If it had to end, Its better it ended now and not after you were married and in your late thirties or later.
* Give it some time and re-evaluate, feelings always clouds reality. Everyone feels like the universe is conspiring against them after something bad happens. Time heals most wounds if you let it.
* Stay Positive. I am 33 years old, have never been in a relationship, no marriage proposal seems to work out for myriad reasons, yet I keep faith while also keeping fit, enjoying my life, finding new interests and try to travel as much as I can amidst incredibly heavy pressure from my parents and ""society"". Last thing one needs is to give in to bullshit societal standards. Love has no sell by date.
* You mentioned you love to travel, do more of it, its a great distraction. Plan a trip in the near future. Travel has healing and transformative powers.

I wish you all the best!
  The dude lived in the city for 20+ years and wants to go farm? Let him. He seems passionate about it, don’t hold him back.

As for you, you are too young to be worried about what’s gonna happen to you. Take it easy and move on; you have no idea what’s in store. 

That ablanaari shit was funny though 😊 >I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head

Stop worrying about that crap and work on making yourself a better person. Pickup some new hobbies. Hang out with your friends or try making new ones. I have to admit that I have not travelled as much as you did.

But my only suggestion right now is to pack your bag and leave your home.
 You will get a  better solution as I am pretty sure you will meet up someone who has solutions to all your problems. 

LPT: Just talk to as many people as possible. find new things to do. the less you sit and ponder, the better it'll be. give it time, and then ponder, and let go.

live life forward, not backwards. You took the right longterm decision. The blaming, bitterness and sadness for a few months is common. Convince and coax your mind that you took a good positive long-term decision for the reasons you have yourself mentioned. 

*Express* your thoughts and justifications and plans in some way. For me, writing them in detail in a diary worked. But if you're not into writing, record an audio or video of yourself discussing it with yourself. 

Or if you have a close friend who's a good listener, express it in front of them. I don't know the psychology behind why expressing your thoughts to yourself or others actually helps, but it does.

As for fear of society, most people don't bother and those who trash talk you can be ignored or even belittled. Solo life is not bad as you yourself already seem to have explored it quite a bit. I'd suggest getting into any new relationship only for positive reasons - such as love and companionship - and never for negative or shallow reasons - such as fear / reputation / social status.  take it from a 24 y/o guy, who got cheated multiple times and lost faith in love.

Smoke a joint, let go off things, and start afresh. 30 ain't too old. You still have a good 4-5 years before you settle down. Goodluck and learn to forgive but not forget :) 30+something, just broke up. Its very normal to hate your ex even if he/she hasnt done anything horrible.

Be kind to yourself. Im not a believer in god or spirituality but mindfulness has helped me. What are you going through is grief. Its the same feeling as you would feel if a loved one died.

MBA is an expensive decision and should be taken with much more thought and is not a guarantee to reduce or remove your current confusion.

You have an advantage of being in a more developed country surrounded by fast growing economies along with India as a back-up. You already have some professional assets/experiences in place. Use that to discover more and learn and spend your life savings on a degree when you are sure about what you want.  So you're talking about career shift and rapid growth. with a managerial experience and international exposure, an international mba from top 20 would be a good bet.

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Aur programme ki jagah program karna seekhna.

Waise freelancers ki koi aukaat nahi hai, and i can prove that. Freelancer.com pe jaake koi bhi project daalna, india se freelancers toot padenge. I’ll just add some information to help you make your decision:
Entry level job in Infosys pays ~25k per month. But during their training period there is virtually no expenditure. 
 If you are going to learn programming for job security (and considering robots a threat, no less), without having any knowledge about it, I'd say try something else you already know. Programming can be fun but your motivations are not in line with what makes it fun. Absolutely, try it. But don't expect to earn decently in a matter of a couple of years.

Similarly, ""an online business"" is too vague. If you have some particular thing in mind, we can probably give you a fair idea if we'll buy it or not. 

If I were in your position, I'd try programming for a couple of months and look at what I can possibly sell online and if I can find business partners. I'll tell my experiences here and *then* ask how I should proceed.
 You can land yourself a high paying programming job provided you have good credentials like hackerearth rank / GSoC rank / github profile. I have seen a unemployed non-IT BSc Chemistry 27 year old guy do it by self learning coding. Good luck !! Working in jewellery factory means what? Are you a Craftsman? Learn to communicate clearly what you have experience doing otherwise people without understanding your background might give misleading advice?

If you do have some years of training and skill with your hands in making jewellery then it's not a bright idea to switch to programming. Unless you don't like your job, keep improving your skill. A skilled person plus a machine will always beat a skilled person alone or a machine alone. 

The problem with robots (like your cell phone), every two years maintaining them and updating software and changing their hardware designs (because what customers want change constantly and hardware improves constantly) is very very expensive. So having skilled people operating machines is always going to be the better choice.

Jewellery sector in India is quite big and growing esp exports. The amounts people are spending on top quality jewellery has hugely increased. 
One option maybe is to try to move to better companies/bigger brand names/export oriented companies etc and gain experience.  Typical Indian mentality : get on the IT wagon == one true and absolute certain way of survival.

So sad. the real question is why would IT companies hire you as a software dev?

there are too many of us already, and for you to catchup its going to be extremely hard. even if you somehow become good enough, 6lpa will not be what they would be paying.

Not saying it can't be done, but you should know that to make big money at big N companies, you really have to become great coder. Which is something I have been struggling with.

>can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator. and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.

Yes, you can. no permision or licences are required.

>do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

No you do not. Unless you are running a factory consuming alot of electricity. Get your shop later once you make a profit.

>do i need to pay rent to parents.

Up to you, if you feel your parents deserve the revenue for allowing you to conduct business from their home. (personal relations)

>can i cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

NO, this is your business. so it will not affect his job

>do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

NO

>do i need current account.

It is advisable to get it as you can separate your personal expense from the business expense, so get it. Most current accounts allow a minimum balance of only 10k 

If you are looking for markets to showcase your product, PM me.  You're overthinking this OP. Forget about permissions and licenses and everything else. 

Get sales first. Everything comes after that. 

Just make sure to not make your dad a director in the company (pvt ltd). Government employees can't be directors in private companies Good luck mate!
 I am very curious about your product and I hope you will post an update about it once you launch it. All the best. You need to give more information. 

What is the per piece sale price, and what is the size of the product? 

Who are your customers? How do you plan to sell the product and in what quantity.

The answers to these may change the answers to your questions. Can't you rent a shop for few months for your trial phase? 

Since your dad is a government employee, is the housing accommodation provided by his employee? If he is a government employee, then someone out there can create a fuss if they want to. That's the nature of it, and legality or the illegality of it comes later.

But again, you are at the moment not making any money. So it's okay to launch from your house. But as soon as you start making money, talk to a lawyer to see if your business needs special permits that can make your operations illegal. For instance, since the house is in your dad's name, he could be accused of moonlighting on a commercial venture. 

If you cannot find a leased space, you could also talk to your university or universities in the vicinity. Many of them have entrepreneurship cells and they could help you out with something (leasing out space, etc.)
 Bhai best of luck I wish you all the best. I can't answer your question as I am a salaried professional..

But I'd like an update once things start rolling for you.

Keep us updated.

Cheers!  [deleted] how useful is your inventions, what scale do you think you can see your invention is going to be used/sold/made.

where in the world do you see your invention being used? If you're even slightly suspicious about the advantage your invention has in a country, I'd suggest you go there and apply for a patent. The chinese would definitely give fuckall respect to your patent and will clone it anyways.

I've invented a stationary utility device and now want to turn it in a business. I've applied for design, patent,trademarks as Intellectual properties. I have completed msme and gst registration. i've prepared visiting cards, proprietor stamp, installed billing software and a 100 pgs letterpad. I have a batch of 400 pcs ready to test the market .  I won't disclose it before the launch so please don't ask about it (no offence).

Not bragging just giving the information, I've done everything alone from research to paperwork to purchase raw material to manufacturing( plastic parts come from factory. i have to assemble it and pack in the box) to finance/money stuff (ca does gst returns). It has really taken a toll on me.

&#x200B;

here's my work environment.

i want to operate from home. my parents are agreed to this and i have access to half of first floor. it's a single room where i do the assembly(tightening screws to join parts) and packing and in one corner i have a table where i do rest of company related work from a laptop.

i'm trying to outsource the packing and assembly but still i'll have to store raw materials and final stock in that room till sent to amazon warehouse or factory.

&#x200B;

i really don't have budget for renting a shop and hiring employee. i want to execute this testing phase alone. if it'll be successfull then i'll get a shop, employees and other equipments but rightnow i don't want to create too much financial burdon on my parents

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

my queries are

1. can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator.  and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.
2. do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

&#x200B;

3.  do i need to pay rent to parents.

&#x200B;

4. can i  cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

&#x200B;

5. do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

&#x200B;

6 do i need current account. my expenses are small and i'm currently operating from savings account.  banks (hdfc, icici, bob,axis) are asking for in house verifications and demanding a banner in front of my house. i'll never put a banner in front of house as padosi bade madar\*\*\*\* hain.

GOI will need a separate department of International taxation to tax all the millionaires who accepted foreign citizenships... Idk why you talk of dividend income as if it's untaxed. Dividends are given after tax. Then there is also dividend distribution tax and some cess on it.  We badly need an inheritance tax as well to address the wealth inequalities.

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” & “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)","With the recent Oxfam India Inequality report & Congress' Minimum Income Guarantee announcement, why aren't we discussing AOC's 70% marginal tax in India already?"
680,Business/Finance,"Is this a copy-pasta or did you actually spend time making up this...whatever this is Here's the TL;DR for people who just want the important stuff, without the bells and whistles that I have to attach just to keep your short attention span:

* If you're thinking about investing, take a moment to realize that, strictly in the financial sense, you're doing better than most people in the country.
* Be aware of the people who will try to stick you with expensive and bad investments. Not everyone is out to look for your best interests.
* Make sure you're bringing in more money than you're spending. Without any money left over at the end of the month, you've got bigger fish to fry. Mmhhmm, tasty fish.
* Make sure you've got all your loans and debts under control. After your monthly EMIs, think about setting a little more money aside to prepay. Loans with higher interest rates, like credit card loans, take priority. Borrowing money isn't bad, but not having a plan to repay definitely is.
* Pick up a book every once in a while. Start reading any book that picks your curiosity and gradually move towards more topical books on personal finance. It's good for your health.
* Don't invest in gold, or any other commodity. You've got better options than that. As an investment, gold does nothing but sit there and look at you. The exit plan is just hoping that someone will pay higher than what you paid.
* Don't mix insurance and investing. They are two different services, why would you want to mix them? By separating the two, you're making your financial life simpler and easier. 
* Only buy a house if you're going to live in the said house. Property as an investment is not liquid, aces high transaction costs, requires government approvals, faces high maintenance costs and exists without any transparency.
* Identifying bad investments is a greater skill than identifying good investments. Gold and real estate are bad investments. Stocks and bonds are good investments. Mutual funds that invest in stocks and bonds allow you to benefit from them.
* Have patience. All investing is for the long term. The stock market will move up and it will move down. Some days, it won't move at all. None of this should matter to you, because all you care about is the fact that over periods longer than 10 years, the stock market has always created a great amount of wealth.
* Don't watch any televised business news channel. They give you the news of the day. You're not worried about the day. You care about the year and the decade. For news, read newspapers like Livemint and Reuters India.
* Here's a basic plan: when you get paid, make sure you pay all required EMIs on your outstanding loans. With what is left, estimate your expenses for the month. This estimate will get better with time. Take out the money etstimated, and invest the rest. Begin with having three months of expenses in a liquid fund as an emergency fund. After than, pick 3-8 mutual funds depending on your risk appetite and time horizon. Refer table above for more information. Set up SIPs so that you can force some financial discipline on yourself. Review the plan annually.
* This basic plan will require tweaking based on the context of your life. But having that plan is important.
* Investing is not rocket science. Assuming you're individual of average intelligence and awareness, even you can do it with quite satisfactory results. Beware of people who will try to convince you that investing is like open heart surgery.

&#x200B; Really well written and a fun read. Thanks for the write up. This should be a sticky at /r/indiainvestments     * Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks. Please read the offer documents carefully before investing. I used to enjoy your Last week in economy series OP. Keep up the good work. Any plans to bring it back? Huge fan here.  Great write up, OP.


If I can set aside 1,00,000 INR per month aside for investing for a year, is  creating NRE FD good or a bad decision? ",1542695345.0,1,11,0,29,"# So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.
&nbsp;

All your life, all you've ever wanted, is a little bit of money. And congratulations, now you have it. Does it feel nice? Does it feel like a dream come true? Of course it doesn't. It's all just numbers on a screen, staring at you like a pathetic joke. But thanks to your thankless job, you made yourself a little bit of money. How nice.

And now, you, in all your half-decayed intelligence, have decided that you want to invest the little bit of money that you've made? Well, step right up to the raging wildfire that is the field of investing. We've got a shit-show full of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, gold and other commodities, all clamouring for your attention, and even more for your money. Done properly, you can retire into an ungodly amount of wealth. And done poorly, you can join the majority of investors setting their cash on fire, day in and day out. 

But don't feel daunted or scared. You're on the right path, and that's probably the only time you're going to hear those words in your life. Just the fact that you're thinking about investing your money puts you at a major advantage, just the fact that you've even made a little bit money is extremely rare. Look around you, what do you see? People that are so poor that they're crawling out of their tents on the roadside, people that are such douchebags that they're buying worthless bling like fur sweaters and gold chains, people that are so childish that they absolutely have to buy the latest iPhone with their credit cards, and people that are so dumb that they just can't be bothered to learn about investing. Just the fact that you're here now, thinking about investing, makes you part of an exclusive club.

Before you get ahead of yourself and feel one cent of happiness for being better off than most, let me tell you something - there's an army of twats waiting to screw you out of the little bit of money that you've made, an army of twats who wants to take away the only thing that matters to your miserable existence anymore. These are crooked relationship managers who'll sell you anything to get commissions. These are unsuspecting relatives who'll recommend terrible investments just because they don't know any better. These are seedy stock brokers who'll push schemes offering incredibly high returns that are too good to be true. These are corrupt financial advisors who'll destroy your returns, either because they're incompetent or unscrupulous, or both. You've got an entire armada of twats just waiting to snatch the money right out of your wallet. What're you going to do about that? Are you going to put your head down and hand over the cash? Are you going to run to your mommy like the little bitch that you are? No, you're going to pull out a knife and stab that little twat right in the heart. And here's how to do that, beginning with a set of basic guidelines. 

&nbsp;
##### Savings are sexy
Let's be honest, you were never made of the stuff that gave wet dreams to women. Well, here's your chance. You know what all the girls like these days? It's not that ripped chest, or that sleak jawline. It's a man who saves. Step aside AXE body spray, there's a new sheriff in town. If you're spending more than you're earning, you've got bigger problems to worry. Before anything else, you need to make sure that you're bringing in more money than you're spending. So reign in your spending, delay gratification. That burger is going to taste pretty much the same without the overpriced slice of cheese. And the movie will probably be on Netflix in a few months.

&nbsp;
##### Debt is your kryptonite
So you borrowed a little bit of money and are now stuck with the interest payments. That's okay, who hasn't done dumb stuff when they were young and full of hormones. I know I have. This one time I cleaned up an entire jar of mayonnaise thinking it was yogurt. Set some money aside every month, not just to pay the monthly minimum on your loans, but a little more so you can pre-pay all your debts. Some loans take priority over others: pay off your credit cards, personal loans and similar high-interest debt first. Keep in mind that not all loans are straight poison: those that help you develop assets like a home loan or increase future income like an education loan or business loan are alright. However, investing while carrying a high amount of debt is like playing football with one leg tied behind your back. Not exactly ideal.

&nbsp;
##### Read like your life depends on it
Stop reading WhatsApp forwards, pick up a book, and then pick another one. If you don't develop a habit of reading properly, you're going to get a lot of poop flinged at you in this business. But if you can make it through a book every once in a while, get read to fling some poop on the n00bs. You don't have to go straight for the finance section. Begin with any book that sounds interesting to you, and work your way up. Reading not only helps you understand the world around you, but also develops a better personality and temperament within you. Most of you have the patience and memory of a goldfish, and generally speaking, goldfishes are not good investors.

&nbsp;
##### Gold is old
Gold was what housewives in the 70s stockpiled in their cupboard because they had no other option. But you, you are the child of the 20th century. You actually know how to turn on the wi-fi. You have better options, like mutual funds. No matter what your uncle from the third cousin over says, investing in gold is setting your cash on fire. All it will do is make you feel good from the inside, while the eternal fireplace fuelled by your cash keeps burning in the background. Gold and silver are metals that we dig out of the ground. As an investment, they just sit there and stare at you. Just because they shine doesn't mean they're good investments. However, not everyone is convinced of this basic guideline. So if you're hell bent on investing in gold, I recommend going into the mountains and throwing yourself off a tall cliff. A medium-sized one works too.

&nbsp;
##### Insurance =/= Investing
While housewives in the 70s had gold, housewives in the 80s had LIC*. Getting life insurance is critical if you have family that depends on your income, but insurance and investing, like pizza and pineapple, never mix well. Have you ever wondered what the insurance company does after collecting your premium money? Well, the company invests your premium money in stocks and bonds, which is also what mutual funds do. So let the insurance people insure, and let the investing people invest. Separation of labour was something that the caveman figured out in 2nd century. It's time you evolved from being a caveman.

&nbsp;
##### Real estate is not real investing
The only reason for you to buy property is if you're going to be living in it. Buying real estate purely as an investment is one of the worst decisions you could ever make. Real estate: is an illiquid market (need to wait to find a buyer or seller), has high transaction costs (stamp duty and other bullshit charges), has a lot of red tape (needs several government approvals) and faces high maintenance costs (occasional cost of paint and plumbing here and there). However, every other Tom, Dick and Harry will tell you that real estate is a great investment. Why? Because real estate is how Indians signal wealth to others. It is how Indians demand respect from the *chaar log* committee. It's how we tell people that we've got a big dick, and we're not afraid to swing it around. You don't have a big dick. Tuck that little stinker back in your pants. You're just embarrassing yourself.

&nbsp;
##### Pick your poison properly
Identifying the bad investments is a greater skill than identifying the good investments. Now that gold and real estate have been vilified as bad investments, let's turn to the places that actually deserve your money - mutual funds. For the uninitiated, which includes most of you idiots, a mutual fund collects your money and invests it in the stock market on your behalf. A diversified basket of stocks in good quality companies will outperform most other investments over any time period longer than 10 years. Mutual funds can give you this diversified basket of stocks. If you haven't been living under a rock for the past few years, you've probably see the advertising campaign - *Mutual Funds Sahi Hai*. And if you have been living under a rock, stay there. We're doing great without you.

&nbsp;
##### Get yourself into a coma
The best investors, the ones who win the game in the long-term, always have patience. When you're investing in stocks or mutual funds, you need to have a minimum time horizon of more than 5 years. Any less than that, and out come the fireplaces that are fuelled by your cash. Mentally, you need to be in a place where the stock market might run off a cliff screaming into the wind tomorrow morning, and you'll still continue investing as per your plan because you're thinking about the long term. This ensures that your emotions, influenced by the ups and downs of the stock market, don't get in your own way. Ideally, you want to invest and immediately get yourself into a coma. Trust me, no one will notice that you're gone. You're one person in a world with seven billion people. You're really insignificant in the larger scheme of the Illuminati.

&nbsp;
##### Don't watch CNBC
All your life, you've only made socially acceptable choices, because you crave validation from the people around you. To your repitillian brain, approval from strangers feels better than an orgasm. But when it comes to investing, never seek validation of your choices, especially not from the pundits on CNBC. Televised business news focuses on the shortest of short terms, while you need to keep your eye on the longest of long terms. Yes, it is important to keep tabs on current events, but there are far better sources of information than the nightly news. I recommend reading Livemint and Reuters for news. Those two outfits did not pay me to endorse them, but if the PR people over there are reading this, give me a call. I accept cash, cheques and PayTM. Fuck it, I'll even take bitcoin.

&nbsp;
##### Keep It Simple, Shithead
Here is a basic plan on how to use your money when you get paid every month. First off, take care of any loans by paying off the hungry bankers who will come demanding their pound of flesh. Pay off all credit cards, in full and on time. Now, estimate how much you're going need for your monthly bills - this includes everything from your electric bill to your tab at the local bar. Deduct that amount and invest the rest of your money. When it comes to investing, begin by putting in three months of your monthly expenses in a liquid mutual fund. This is your emergency cash stash. Next up, depending on your time horizon and risk appetite, select a combination of ~3-8 mutual funds. There are a few different types of mutual funds, here's a handy rule of thumb to navigate them:
 
|                                    | High time horizon             | Low time horizon  |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| **Low risk appetite**  |Large-cap equity funds      |Debt mutual funds  |
| **High risk appetite** |Mid/small/multi-cap equity funds|Debt mutual funds  |
 
When you're done, set up SIPs so that you don't have to do the transfers manually each month. Every year, take some time off to review this process.

&nbsp;

This basic plan will require tweaking, depending on the context of your life. But having that plan is very important, not just for your financial life but also for the rest of your life. In the back of your mind, you've always known that. But you never followed through on making a plan, and now your life is just a series of mistakes and regrets. Is that why you drink so much? 

The lords of literature require that I write a conclusion to this piece. But this is not the end. This is the beginning of your investing journey. The basic guidelines mentioned here are intended to serve as the starting point for your own research. These guidelines are not rocket science, they are not supposed to be complicated. A person of average intelligence and awareness can reasonably expect to understand and follow them. The question is: are you a person of average intelligence and awareness? Assuming that enough of you read this, statistics require half of you to admit that you're dumb as a rock.

Always keep an eye out for the armada of twats that will try to convince you that investing is rocket science, simply so they can charge you high fees or lure you into unprofitable investments. Done poorly, you can expect a mid-life crisis magnified by a bonfire of your cash. Done properly, you can create the kind of wealth that can benefit you as well as your future generations. You've already disappointed your parents. Don't disappoint your children now.

681,Business/Finance,"Glad your family situation is better.  Can you call the college office during working hours and see if they are willing to look into this? 

Any degree is good. B. Com should be good if you plan a business in future or pursue further studies like MBA/CA.  Bhai get back your career on track.
The best thing you could do to support your family. How old are you now ?

What do you do for a living ?


 First, go to Mumbai right away to collect your documents from the college!

Second, take it as a fresh start. If you are not sure of B.Com, think of some other option. If you are concerned about the time wasted, you could perhaps enroll for a correspondence program from IGNOU until the next academic year? Dude, from your replies, I notice you're 20. So, first off you have time on your side - LOADS of it! That's a good thing.

Now coming to your conundrum, I understand you may be anxious to share it with some admin guy in your college.  However, if it helps you re-secure your place in the college, I'd say it's worth it. However, you have to be prepared for the worst case scenario that they may not take you back. So you gotta keep your options open.

Finally, yes [B.Com](https://B.Com). is worth it. However, IF you can do, I'd suggest doing something in Economics. If you do well in Economics, there usually are good opportunities, including scholarships for Masters. Just by 2 cents. Happy to discuss if you have any further questions.  ",1539949179.0,1,19,0,36,"Sorry this is a bit long. Tl;dr at bottom

&#x200B;

I come from a middle-class family in Gujarat, and I passed my 12th commerce from a CBSE school. I got good grades and was able to enroll in a very good college in Mumbai, and everything was going well for me. After I got my admission I went back to my hometown to prepare to move to Mumbai in a hostel, when my grandfather who was already in ill-health passed away.

&#x200B;

Now he did not have a will and most of what we owned was in my father's elder brothers name already and what was in my grandfathers name was usurped by him as well. He kicked my father out of the family business as well as made threats for us to leave the place we were staying in(It was registered to my grandpas name). This meant my own families financial status went from somewhat stable to completely in shambles. We were blindsided and that meant I had to stay and help my father weather the storm. At first I thought we'd bounce back in a month or 2 and having never known poverty I never knew ho much people struggled. But it only got worse for us. My father is an 8th pass and could not get normal jobs, so he decided to start a new business and I took a job with a friend of his due to my English skills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After some time passed then scumbag had us evicted as he and my aunt(bua) made some deal that she should have the house. I do not know the details of what they did but we were forced to rent a place and our already poor finances were shot to pieces. My father started to work as a salesman cause no other option and I took on a bigger role at his friends place. But things were still hard and we were barely making ends meet.

&#x200B;

I forgot all about my college and education, never going back to Mumbai after my enrollment. My family trudged along for 2 and a half years but things are changing now. My father has a childhood friend who is offering my father a good role in his business back in their old village. He is moving there and starts at first November. Now he told me that I can finally go to Mumbai and finish my college if I wanted to but I'm not even sure what to do at this point.

&#x200B;

I never went to Mumbai after my admission but this year would have been my final year. Am I still even enrolled there? They have my documents as I never collected them back. But I never paid any fees except what you pay on enrollment. My father wants me to go and try to study as he thinks his lack of education was a major reason for our family's crisis cause he had nothing to fall back on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I don't even know if I am enrolled there anymore. The college is affiliated with Mumbai university but I could not find any details about their code on skipping exams\[By exams I mean skipping everything :( \] on google. And even If I'm still enrolled how long would it take me to finish my degree. Hell at this point I'm pondering is a [B.com](https://B.com) even worth it? My dream was to do a masters from foreign but even If I finish my degree will I get enrollment in any institute as I had these many drop years. I am really confused at this point weather to move to the village with my family or try to pursue an education.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any knowledge on how Mumbai university operates or even any advice on how to proceed please help me.

Tl;dr : Scumbag uncle and aunt usurped everything and I could not attend a single day of college. Now I may finally be able to go but Idk if I am even enrolled there anymore. Please help. Any advice appreciated.","Due to family problems, I had to forego my college education. Now I may have the option to finally do something about that. Please advice me on how to proceed? [Long]"

 >Why has the government backed away from the EV policy? 

They haven't. There is still a large subsidy for EV's and where I live, public charging infrastructure is being tested privately on a large scale.  It's going to take time to come to all cities. But they haven't backed down at all. 

Source: I am in the EV Vehicle industry. I'm listening to him talk about job creation right now. It's literally the dumbest shit I've ever heard. He's fucking assuming that people are creating jobs for other people.

Example 1: X number of students graduated from law school. If we assume that each of them started their own practice and employed 2 people then, Y number of jobs have been created. WTF?  BECAUSE CONGRESS...NEHRU...60 YEARS...EMERGENCY...HINDU IS IN DANGER! 


^^^^^^hint ^^^^^^you ^^^^^^won't ^^^^^^get ^^^^^^any ^^^^^^answers But..but..but..but.. Hindus are in danger  So many questions but there is one answer for all of them. Nehru. 100/100. Wah Modiji Wah. Forgive my lack of knowledge, but are there any inherent problems with giving special status to a state?

Also how come demonetisation led to loss of so many jobs?

Also isnt the problems with money deposits in swiss bank is that there is no way to force swiss banks to disclose details without seriously damaging diplomatic ties? Modi's reply - Bhak saala. Bjp govt is illegally controlling Admk and TN govt. This must stop.

Kiran bedi must mind her own business in puducherry.

Mining and frackong projects of ambani and adani fraudsters must stop in TN.  Wrote NP by mistake. Fixed the flair.  Fuck him. He said 1 crore jobs were made,by some ""independent survey"" and disregarded the government figures  Kek. This is so uninformed, it is hilarious!

> 5) Rafale Deal: Is there a secret pact between France & India to not reveal the cost of defence equipment being bought?

No, the pact is in the public domain. Further, the aggregate price can be revealed, and has been. In Parliament. The details cannot. 

> Why was contract taken away from HAL and given to a businessman?

Was it? Proof?

> 6) Doklam: Why was issue not raised during PM’s China summit (April 2018)?

It wasn't? Proof? If it wasn't, why did the statement mention ""peace and tranquility in all areas of the India-China border region""? u/kumbhakaran is an avid Parliament watcher.

He's be pleased to see this exhaustive list.

But all these count for zilch unless your MP raises them in Parliament and gets the govt to answer.

Can you write to your MP? Why does the goberment of Chindia tolerate weapons training camps of Bajrang Dal and RSS? This is waaaay too long to read in whole, but a couple of things I noticed near the top, a few questions I too want the answer to:

> 5) ... Why was contract taken away from HAL and given to a businessman?

Why should HAL get the contract by default? In fact, why should HAL exist in the first place? Why should any PSU exist? It is not the govt's job run the industry or banking or whatever. Rather, focus on privatizing the PSUs.

> 10) Why MSP not raised to 1.5 times of C2, as recommended by Swaminathan committee? (TMC MP)

Thank our lucky stars it wasn't! Why should MSP be raised? What evidence is there that increasing MSP benefits farmers? Why should there be a subsidy in farming in the first place? The focus should be on industrialization and creating blue collar jobs so that people don't have to be engaged in farming in the first place.
 There is this tiny question but carries a lot of weight. Who is the FM? Wtf is happening with the cabinet? Jaitley, Parrikar go off duty while being elected and stay invisible for months and some Tom Dick & Harry is a finance expert overnight? How is this okay? TL;DR. Where the fuck are my 15 lakhs!

FARMERS AND AGRARIAN DISTRESS


Quote
Indian farmers have, for long, ensured that the country does not face any food shortage. The time has finally come for the PM to declare: “I am confident Indian farmers can feed the nation, I annul the Essential Commodities Act”. The most critical reform to revolutionise Indian agriculture requires no money. It requires something far harder to acquire — learning to unlearn yesterday’s wisdom.

",Questions that Narendra Modi must answer. Please have a look and add your own questions. [NP]
683,Business/Finance,"> 01.At the age of 50 is it worth ACCEPTING offer??? 

depends on what kind of life you are aiming for. there are trade-offs involved when you immigrate, so you need to look at the big picture. it's not just a financial decision, but one that involves your family, future generations, cultural changes, weather/climate changes, etc.

&#x200B;

> 03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate??? 

Please go through the NB PNP website in great detail. Read through the entire website and the application guide, etc. Do not just trust what the consultant is telling you. The canadian immigration process is quite transparent- the process is well outlined so everything you need to know will be on their website, including forms, documents required, fees, etc. Also, from the website, it seems that NB is not accepting applications for PNP currently.

&#x200B;

> 04. What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??

again, go through the NB PNP website. you'll find all the information there

&#x200B;

> 05. It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed??? 

I'd suggest you pose this question in a canada immigration or legal community. In my opinion, such bonds are not enforceable in Canada, but i'm not a 100% sure

&#x200B;

> 06. I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer. 

Cleaner air, less crime, better work life balance, higher respect for life, effective government/ public administration systems, tax dollars that actually work and benefit residents

&#x200B;

> 08. Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security?? 

not sure what this certificate is but again, please go through the NB PNP site in detail. that will tell you what you need and do not need

&#x200B;

> 10. Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.??? 

most big cities in the maritimes have indian stores and restaurants. you will be able to find most spices and ingredients, but you probably won't be able to replicate your culinary preferences a 100%

&#x200B;

> 11. Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier?? 

Please search ""canada express entry"" in google. that seems to be a popular PR channel these days

&#x200B;

> 13. My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources. 

There are a number of options, so depends on what you're looking for. Also, i doubt if any city in canada has ""pleasant"" weather. Vancouver is probably the only city that has a slightly bearable winter.

&#x200B;

To summarize, i would say to read the NB PNP website and express entry website in detail. as i mentioned, do not just trust what the consultant is saying. do your own due diligence.

&#x200B; Kem chho Pandya kaka... I will try to answer your concerns. My background: I was 15 when my father immigrated to Canada from Vadodara.

Here are my responses:

> Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.

$60,000 should give you savings (even with wife + son), but you should negotiate. Your fixed costs each month would be: rent, groceries (food), travel/commute, phone etc. For rental rates, check kijiji.ca. Groceries can be $400-500. Travel I'd say up to $200. Phone could be easily $200-$250 for 3 people. 

> Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate???

Work permit and then PR sounds about right. Not sure about accuracy of the information. Try canadavisa.com forums and ask there, it is a very active community.

> What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??

If you are being offered a job, the company should be taking care of any visa fees. They should even reimburse you if only the applicant is allowed to pay the visa fees by CIC. Clarify this with the company before accepting the offerf.

> It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???

I don't think companies have bonds in Canada. You can usually leave work in 2-4 weeks notice (as per terms of employment). And companies can do the same, they can let you go with the same notice. I'd recommend starting in summer so it is easier for you to adopt to the weather

> I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer.

Benefits:
- /u/das_halifax did a good job summarizing.

> Are any specialised engineering study institutes/universities being there for part time study??

Not sure. If you don't find much, let me know and I'll do some research for you.

> Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security??

Absolutely not. No NOC required from your job's wife for you to go.

> My son is studying in 10th Standard. Is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in India or he should study there?

 Best bit for you is your son is in a perfect age to hit a jackpot. As I said, I was 16 when we immigrated. Best thing is that Indian high school system is rigorous while in Canada, high school is a breeze (comparatively), while universities are a significant jump in difficulty. At your son's age, he will get a significant advantage as he would already know much of the content in Maths and Science that is taught here in Grade 11 and 12. But he has to grab the opportunity as well. If I were in India, the best I would have thought of was LD college of engineering, or MS University of Baroda, yet I was able to do Engineering from University of Toronto, which is better than any IIT. Keep in mind that he has to grab the opportunity. I had plenty of Indian friends, but almost none of them took the opportunity. I had done 11th standard in India, and had to do 11th and 12th again here. If your son studied in Gujarati medium, he might have to work hard initially. I was in English medium. If he studies all the way until 12th in India, a downside is that now Canadian universities don't know how he measures up against local applicants, and now he might be competing against International applicants. So, better if he is part of Canadian high school system before 12th. (He will likely have to give IELTS (academic module)/TOEFL regardless, btw).

> Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.???

Every small town in Canada has it. But no guarantees that you'll like the taste. Often, Indian restaurants in remote towns cater to taste buds of white people than Indians. A tradeoff of not living in Toronto, I guess.

> Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier??

Try express entry. Check [CRS tool](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp) and see how much you score. As of Oct 2018, people with score of 442 were granted PR.

> 12 My elder son is of 22 years. How can I sponsor him other than student Visa?

Please don't go for student visa. You have the right thinking. People come here with admission in any random college. In Canada, college = diploma, university = degree. If he has done bachelors, and working, best bet is for him to get 2-3 years of experience and apply through express entry (try CRS tool for him as well). I know someone who immigrated recently at age of 25 and is doing pretty good. PR from day 1 and none of the struggles that people who come on student visa go through.

I don't think you can sponsor him. He has to apply by himself as he is already 21. He may get additional points if you are a PR/citizen, but not sure. You'll have to confirm with the CRS link above.

> My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources.

Pleasant weather? Vancouver. But it also rains a lot in Vancouver in summer. Still better than having snow in other parts of Canada though. Vancouver is crazy expensive to live in though, because of chinese black money in real estate. Second, I'd put Toronto. Less snow than other parts of Canada, and even cities like Ottawa, Montreal. Toronto is expensive as well, but Toronto suburbs should work out well.


Concluding thoughts:
- It is a big change to move at age of 50. As you said, you are resetting your social, family life, and business. At this point, you are moving for the sake of your son than yourself. *If it was just you and kaki, I wouldn't recommend immigrating.*
- Please consider the fact that you are also subjecting your wife to a completely new environment, with no relatives around. There are a few Gujaratis in NB now (Moncton, Fredericton etc) but most are international students, so not sure how you'd relate.
- Call me emotional, but it still haunts me that my future generations won't be able to communicate with me in Gujarati if I remain in Canada the rest of my life. Not that they won't know how to, but they won't be comfortable. In 2-3 generations, the language will be wiped out from your family. Also, same thing about good values that might be unique to India. I am still not at peace with this, and am planning on returning back in a couple of years.

PM me if you'd like to discuss more. We can chat over WhatsApp if you'd like. You make the decision, but I can make you aware of all the realities based on the experience I'v gathered here in more than a decade, and that might help you make the decision. Your salary is quite low man, even for N.B. Since you are going with a teenage son, who will enter college, your wife will have to work otherwise you won't be happy at all. Incredibly paltry salary, and there are very few opportunities available in St. Johns for getting higher salary than this. That place has very high unemployment rate. Sort this aspect out, rest everything will fall in place.  I'd advice you to post this in r/canada and r/abcd as well. You might get better answers there. Having traveled to both countries.  100000 times yes 50 is 25 in Canada. You are quite the young man, sir. Good luck. r/iwantout What are you waiting for? As long as you have done homework on validating the PR in 6 months claim, what do you have to lose?  Stay there for 5 to 7 years, become a citizen, get your son a decent shot at life in Canada and if you don’t like it go back. You have worked till 50 and obviously Ahmedabad has not given you what you are looking for otherwise, you would not be thinking about leaving at this stage of life. 

As someone who left India at the age of 17, trust me when I say you will be giving your son the biggest gift any parent can give a child- a gift of choice. 

I say go ahead and don’t look back. Negotiate everything but don’t look back.  Bhaiyya kitni baar bahar gaye ho? Culture shock na ho jaye kahi sare aam chumma chaati karte logo ko dekh kar😂

And the society there is different. So be prepared that Indian way of thinking needs to be changed. 

Weather will be extremely cold compared to gujarat.  It's not worth it. You shall suffer from the lack of food, a familiar natural environment, social life et cetera. Really not a good decision. ",1541926409.0,1,11,0,22,"I have been holding a license from IRDA, government of India as approved insurance surveyor (for collision of Automobiles) & valuator since 1990. As valuator I have been holding approved licence from other competent authority of India too.

I am Diploma Automobile, post diploma in sales management, B Tech (Mech), MBA Finance, Fellow IIISLA, Alternate dispute resolution and other professional qualifications also. I have my own proprietorship company and having office in prime location of Ahmedabad city of India. As a surveyor we get the allotment of work from insurers. As valuator we generally get the valuation work from banking sector, NBFC etc for refinance purpose of assets like cars, commercial vehicles, Engineering equipment, plant & machineries, earth movers, mining equipment etc.   

Looking to the current scenario of India-Ahmedabad. it seems that the some of the issues like inflation, population, traffic, pollution, reservation, parking issues etc are never going to be solved. They are being increased day by day. India has become of 130 cr. Mentality of certain class people are on too below level and we feel that it is never going to be changed. Business scenario is also being deteriorated due drastic and impractical changes in government policy. Political leaders are minting their own except few. As per international media India is growing but as per my experience picture of actual India is different.

For last 3 years l have been getting job offer from Canada. In 2016 from Alberta and in 2017 from British Columbia etc. I was not sincere about these offers. Taking in a view the worth uses of qualifications, experience and Looking further for better future of my sons I think sincerely this time. The offer is from St john- New Brunswick.

New Bruns wick is an Atlantic province out of total 4 provinces. St john have population of 7.50 lacs approximately. The population have been deviated in last 4 years due to some unknown reasons. I have been offered 60,00 Canadian Dollar per annum from General Insurance company of St John- New Brunswick Canada.  I will be deputed at St John only. I assume that the offer is via authentic consultant of Canada. It is to be noted that nothing is written as off now. I will have to sign the bond for 2 years for the job of said company.  As per my knowledge job profile in st john is same as India. 

The role will be as collision surveyor that is my core competence.   
I have following queries:

01.At the age of 50 is it worth ACCEPTING offer???


02. Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.


03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence.  Are these the information appropriate???


04. What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??


05. It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???

06. I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer.


07. Are any specialised engineering study institutes/universities being there for part time study??


08. Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security??


09. My son is studying in 10th Standard. Is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in India or he should study there?  

10. Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.???


11. Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier??


12 My elder son is of 22 years. How can I sponsor him other than student Visa?


13. My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources.

Please share any other information which are useful.",Is it worth moving to Canada on the basis of job opportunity at the age of 50 as an Indian Male???

Deeply disappointed.. From Twitter: 

Middle Class will now have to pay:

Goods and Service Tax.

Long Term Capital Gain Tax.

Income Tax.

Increased Cess on Income Tax.

This will make them fall in BPL category and hence will be able to avail all Govt Schemes.

Masterstroke by Modi ji. [deleted] Seriously not happy about LTCG. They could have excluded ELSS. Or maybe introduced 0% tax for all holdings greater than 3 years. I have a feeling this will have a bad impact on the market.   Tax Update : Payments in cash exceeding Rs. 10000/\- to be disallowed.  As a pakoda seller, chutney anyone? Middle class being shown the middle finger once again.


Govt never fears any backlash  from them because they  have the most to lose ,but they still aren't powerful enough to have their voice amount to something.


They have to pander to poor people to keep the votes from slipping and
if they don't appease the corporates they'll withdraw their funding.


Middle class they can afford to screw over. Nobody is talking about the elephant in the room.
  
In long term every one is going to get income tax increases because of the public healthcare program.
  
Take countries that have universal healthcare, I'll give you how income taxes look around the world.

+ Canada upto 60%
+ Germany upto 47.475%
+ Sweden upto 60%
  
Take any country that has public healthcare and you'll see tax rates that will make you cry blood.

Now one percent increase in cess might not seem like a lot. Look at how this will affect you in the long term.
  
More over majority of the health ailments are because of life choices and are self inflicted ailments.

+ Fucking drunk people destroying their livers.
+ Something about tobacco users and smokers getting cancer...
+ People eating shitty food and getting sugar and cholesterol... (Heart ailments)
+ Some idiots being irresponsible and having abortion... or having 6 kids for that matter...
etc.
  
Who the fuck pays for BJP's pet project???
  
+ The tax payers who already pay fuck load of taxes on their income and whatever they buy (GST)...
+ People who pay more taxes than their rent.
+ People who don't own cars...
  
Public healthcare is the worst idea ever.

Well take it in the ass and cough up the taxes or get ready to go to jail for not paying taxes.

Edit: Updated Germany tax rates. Immediate update on direct tax changes from the budget speech -

1.	Real estate – double taxation in respect of immovable property. No adjustment where 5% difference is there.

2.	MSME – Corporate tax rate 25% to companies having T/o under Rs. 250 crore in FY 2016-17. Revenue foregone Rs. 7000 crore FY 18-19. 

3.	Salaried tax payers – No changes in structure. Salaried taxpayer – standard deduction of Rs. 40,000/- in lieu of transport and reimbursement of medical expenses. 

4.	Senior citizens – exemption of interest income from FD / RD increased to Rs. 50,000. No TDS u/s 194A for this. Health insurance deduction from Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 50,000. 

5.	Rs. 1,00,000/- deduction u/s 80DDB for critical illnesses for senior and very senior citizens

6.	Payment exceeding Rs. 10,000 in cash disallowed for Trusts. Non-deduction of TDS would be disallowed @ 30%

7.	LTCG tax – Tax LTCG exceeding Rs. 1,00,000/- @ 10% w/o indexation. All gains upto 31.1.18 grand fathered. STCG normal 15%. Tax on distributed income by EOF @ 15%. 

8.	Increase cess by 1%. Total cess @ 4% health and education cess

9.	E assessment – to be expanded 10% LTCG on equity returns is with or without indexation? Are we just going to ignore the FCRA amendments again? 

> 
> The government has for the second time introduced amendment to the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) in the finance Bill, paving the way for both the BJP and Congress to escape legal scrutiny for receiving foreign contribution since 1976, the year FCRA regulations were introduced.

http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/fcra-amendment-in-finance-bill-to-help-bjp-congress-escape-scrutiny-5049589/ Remember, in UPA's government's first term last budget, they gave debt forgiveness to farmers at a national level to win elections. The fact that NDA has not given into anything like that itself is a positive.

Budget overall is ok. More exemption for salaried class is good, LTCG is a non-issue with grandfathered gains. LTCG is there in many countries, markets will factor that in. The only change should have been LTCG at 2-3 years not 1 year.

Increase in cess sucks. Do away with all these cess and rationalize tax brackets and bring more people into the tax net. Tax farmer incomes for fuck's sake. Chud Gaye phir se salaried log Your worst fear is here!

LTCG: Gains exceeding 1 lakh to be taxed at 10% without indexing Salaries of MPs, President and Governor increased! http://www.indiabudget.gov.in/ub2018-19/eb/allsbe.pdf

No allocation for the much hyped health insurance announced today. It is just the meagre same allocation for the existing UPA health insurance.  IIT Madras will work on 5g and block chain  Direct Tax growth 2017\-18 : 12.6&#37;  Nothing but Schadenfreude when seeing actual rich people claiming that they are middle-class and whining that no government does anything for them.  Gobartatti budget for the salaried middle class.  If not for the huge spending on infra,  this was like any vanilla UPA budget.  Anyone with a taxable salary more than 10 lakhs is basically fucked.

EDIT: Double whammy if you had ELSS mutual funds. Get ready to pay additional 10% ""ek gaav may Raghu thatha"" - Arun Jaitley, 2018.  [deleted] Maro pakad ke. Well done on the National Health Protection Scheme (5 lakh for every BPL family every year!) but please don’t implement it by linking Aadhaar to BPL Families. God knows what a can of worms that would create. A BPL card should be enough.

4% cess for income tax payers along with no change in the slabs? Wow. Also 10% tax on Long Term Capital Gains and reduced corporate tax for companies making upto Rs. 250 crores (25%). Corporations need all the deductions it seems. 

If the income tax base rose to 8 crores, could you not give some relief to them by lowering taxes? Would have gotten better tax revenues with a wider base anyway.

Again, the Government sees the middle class as the silent pony to beat around with a stick.

Can someone explain this? Thank you! Does new tax on LTCG imply that people will now try to ensure that they have atleast 1 Lakh LTCG / year, in order to claim max tax benefit? Rural Gujarat gave BJP the shaft while urban stayed with them, so now the govt takes the urban for granted and making attempts to please the rural.  Good Initiative for Senior Citizens!

http://www.financeminutes.com/budget-2018-for-senior-citizens-key-benefits-relief/ I work in fund management and welcome long term capital gains. Allowing people to ride secular bull runs without paying tax promotes inequality. Risk inequities is way overstates especially if you don't sell.

Well, disappointed, but is it enough to vote for Congress in next elections? Aur gaand maar lo bhen chod. Cess increased by 1%. There is so much ignorance in this thread.

Okay first, the cess is already 3% now ... It's been 2-3% since more than 10 years ! And the cess is calculated on the tax you have to pay and not your income. NO, THE MIDDLE CLASS DOES NOT GET FUCKED BY 1% CESS ON TAX.

Second, LTCG. Let's do the math. If you're to earn 1 lakh a year as capital gains and let's say you've earned 10% return in the year, that just means you have had 10lakhs to invest in stock market.

Someone who has 10lakhs to invest in stock market IS NOT MIDDLE CLASS. Middle class in this country is worse off than Cows of this country. Atleast they have Gau-rakshaks to protect their ass After everything is announced and available can someone breakdown the budget and explain everything in layman terms?

This is some big shit. kudos 1 Class Mild aur 1 Rajni Gandha total 32 Rs ka milta tha, ab kitne ka padega ? Thanks for doing this :) [deleted] Standard deduction a beneficial for employees not getting many allowances basically lower middle class or middle class.

http://www.financeminutes.com/standard-deduction-back-budget-2018-relief-to-salaried-employees/ I know this will get downvoted soon, but someone needs to put this out.
A lot of people are saying/posting here how bad it is for salaried people. I posted this somewhere else a while back, and so posting again:

**Less taxes on salaries does not necessarily mean your take home salary will increase. Companies will just pay you lower (look long term not short term). Taxes on salaries are not taxes on individuals but taxes on employers.**

Please. People need to understand it. Less taxes on salaries will just give you more money in the short term. In the long term no difference.

Edit: But seriously, **if you are gonna downvote me, provide with a rebuttal. If you can't, you are contributing to spread of lies/false-information, pretty much like online trolls.** Just that this time you are at the receiving end.

Edit2: Some people think removing all taxes from salaried class people (like done for farmers) won't increase inflation. Salaried class people paid a total of Rs 1.44 lakh crore as taxes (source: http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2018-19/news/budget-2018-standard-deduction-of-rs-40000-on-income-tax-actually-amounts-to-just-rs-10000-benefit/story/269379.html). That much more money and inflation won't increase. Good luck with that.

Edit3: I will delete this post within 24 hours. No point arguing when no one is ready to listen. :)

Edit4: Had I just worded this differently, ""Higher taxes doesn't mean less take home. Companies will be forced to increase salaries."" no one would have complained. :P

Edit5: A similar thing happened during demonitization. All salary-class people hailed Modi as God, Modi finally took the long-standing revenge of the salary-class against all shop-keepers, farmers, business owners. Masterstroke by Modi.
When I tried debating, most salary-classed were like: ""Why should I care, I pay all taxes, all my money is in banks, why should only salary-class pay all taxes?"". Now when the demonitization induced slowdown is gripping the entire country slowly, that is when they realize how brutally naive their arguments were.

Edit6: Ravish Kumar also said the middle class should not crib about the budget when there other much more important things to worry about. Here: https://youtu.be/B8dM1MGxQFw?t=16m53s Meanwhile, Congress is leading in all 3 LS seats in Rajasthan.  What is this long term capital gains tax? Is it a part of income tax or its a separate tax which I have to pay even without having any income? Could somebody ELI5 as to why middle class or salaried citizens are fucked? What were the expectations of which were not met regarding them? More tax on salaried class. Education/health cess goes up by 1 % to 4 % Thread deleted?

Harish Damodaran is a brilliant analyst, so keep an eye on him. Income tax batao yar. Bore ho gaye. The National Health Protection Scheme is more ""Obamacare"" and less NHS. Like earlier governments, this govt has also placed the onus on the private sector. 
 Right now I have a deduction of 60k for vehicles, and 15k for medical. So I'll be paying MORE taxes with the 40k standard deduction The healthcare coverage he talked about sounds splendid - up to 5 lakh rupees per annum for everyone. I wonder how it will get so much funding though. Anand Mahindra Applause!

686,Business/Finance,"I didn't read the whole thing cause I'm super sleepy but larger states must be broken, especially UP. It's easier to govern, it's easier to decentralise the power one or a few states hold in national elections, and it gets easier to carry out govt welfare programmes and other schemes, and people can be equally have a larger voice when it comes to holding the system accountable. Also, faster rates of growth, education, gender equality etc etc. Playing the devil’s advocate: is there any analysis to prove that administrative efficiency is directly proportional to size of state? I know it seems intuitive, but is that the only factor we should consider? What are the factors that are really holding back growth on our states? If every thing else remained constant and we only reduced the size, would we see a better result? ",1542911033.0,1,4,0,9,"Hello everyone, let's discuss about our states. We all know that some of our states are too populated to govern efficiently. However, creation of so many smaller states is very difficult. So, we need Autonomous Regions (AR).

For example, UP has close to 200 million people. There are only four countries on earth with more population than UP ! Even Maharashtra and Bihar had 100 million plus people in 2011. West Bengal had more than 91 million in 2011 too. There are only 13 countries on earth with 100 million club. The US state with highest population is California (39 mil), we have 11 states with more than that.

So, it seems that for better serving the populace we need states with lesser population. State governments tend to keep all power in the hands of a select few leaders and thus failed to spread development evenly around the state.

However, dividing our states into smaller one would be very problematic. It would create political shit storms and turmoils so powerful that no central government would withstand that. Just see what happened during the creation of Telengana. 

So, the better solution would be dividing states into semi-autonomous regions. There are 14 such regions already exist in India like Gorkhaland, Bodoland, Kargil, Ladakh etc.

Bigger states should be divided into a few autonomous regions (AR). It would have its own local governments with limited powers.

The AR's could be like that:

1) Population below 10 millions except the Metropolis AR's like Mumbai, Kolkata etc.

2) The local government of the AR should be formed via Panchayet and Municipal elections by their elected members. Another extra election should be avoided.

3) These AR's should have powers and funds for village and town developments, local road constructions, sanitations, health cares, school education, waterbody and forest conservation, tourism development, industrial developments, land and land reforms etc.

4) The state government will control the police, judiciary, state civil services, higher educational institutions, state highways etc.

5) The state government and the central agencies will collect the taxes. The ARs would collect some local taxes like tolls, small business license fees etc. The tax revenues would be distributed among the AR's, state governments and the central government by the rules of the finance commissions.

6) The AR's would have limited legislative powers which would enables them to pass some laws. However, they would be under the legislative authority of the state.

7) So, there could be more than hundreds of such AR. Every metro city city should form its own AR.

Let's debate.

687,Business/Finance,"Thanks!! [deleted] Good job. Thanks for sharing OP. This needs to be upvoted more. holy cow...i'll have to tldr.
This is what's gonna happen when you pair poor computer literacy, lazy programmers, old cyber infrastructure , fake pateriotism and lack of will for security of public.  We need a wikipedia page for AAdhaar leaks . There are so many of them .  [removed] Thanks a lot man. I have such links just in case I need to slap something my friends with and I don't have it. Having so many of them on a topic at one place is a lot of help. 

Someone should make a list of all fuck ups of modi.  God damn. fuck.   How can I help? I am an experienced web developer.

Perhaps an interactive site or forum or both. People might like to explore this too: r/antiaadhar had to scroll 5 times to get bottom of this! That's a lot of work.
Thnx brah Thanks, this is much needed. Aadhar is being misused by the govt in big way. Does anyone maintain a google drive to store all news articles related to adhaar? Saved Wow ! Top quality content OP! this should be stickied Holy fuck!! [removed] cool Articles can be deleted from websites, no?

We should save it as PDFs! Yes thank you man. This is just what I was thinking about that if someone ever asks for proof about shittyness of Aadhar, this is it. Even the UIDAI would shut their mouths. You the real nigga! 🤘🏻 Nice u/-0-1-

 OP, add this map too

[Forever](https://web.archive.org/web/20180326061115/https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/86z8ww/aadharnama/) What the actual fuck... And the list will continue... I was intending to research it up all by myself when I tumbled on this post of yours. A work less to do..

Thank you for this social service.

May the blinds see it clear. Is there a way to make this list so that it is  the headlines  hyperlinked to the website. Will make the list more shareable online that way as it will be more readable. I only know of a manual way to do it. Ok ",1521961418.0,1,74,0,463,"I collected news reports and articles about Aadhar to serve as a reminder of data leaks and other incidents relating to it. This will serve as a public memory and spread awareness about Aadhar. Do copy it, back it up and spread it.

688,Business/Finance,"Modiji understands the IQ of Indian society very well , sell them dreams and victim complex - Rule forever :)  [deleted] [removed] [removed] [removed] Is that benaami donation clause honestly in the ""finance"" ""bill"" that got squeezed through LS? Feels like people have kind of moved on from that particular fuckery.

Edit: a word >developments in the Supreme court,


Heights of desperation. Nobody has literally any control over the supreme court. It is the most opaque arm of our state, always has been. Stop blaming random shit on modi, your entire argument loses value because you pull shit like this. Can't believe people just automatically upvote anything anti modi without even reading the BS in the post. So it wasn’t since the time of Indira Gandhi?

Modi is the result of the bullshit spawned by Congress over the years. Now, we have the other side corrupting the system to suit their agenda.

I don’t like Modi but I hate Congress worse.  The same SC CJI ruled in favour of AAP govt. in the LG- AAP turf war. 
And why are you blaming Modi, SC judges are appointed by collegium, not our PM Yes, there are several videos and reports which are not from the left per se. its even from centerists who argue this.

Also, you forgot Electoral bonds, which is completely annonmyous way of paying a party.

What factions usually do is try to remove blame from Modi, and pin in on the pre-existing system, absolving the leadership of everything. This is a problem because, the leaderships' inaction, rather...its tweeks to more streamline the process, is in cahoots with the pre-existing system of corruption.

Technically, the present government has not done as much damage as previous ones, but small steps it has taken to legalize corruption, will lead our nation to further ruin.

I am sure that's what our founding fathers would have wanted - ""My father, let my country be led to ruin"" (/s) Generally I think that the more autocratic a government is the more corruption flourishes. This is because fewer people have more power (and so can do bigger scams) and because they face less risks of repercussions. I read somewhere that corruption in India really kicked off with Indira Gandhi, precisely because she was the first leader to centralise a lot of power in just her close advisors/allies Corruption has been a hallmark of indian businesses and politicians way before modi, its like part of its culture and fabric of scoiety that corruption has to exist for things to run at all.

Even some people told me that without corruption, things cant function at all in india, it just depends on whether its big or small. Yeah, it was evident long ago. He's mastered the art of normalizing corruption. They don't even have to hide it. That's why you don't hear about any scams at all these days. If you don't find a view correct please put counter arguments. Downvoting only shows your confirmation bias. Yes. It's pretty good. But I'm hoping with more years in power,I'm hoping they don't make it a competition between people on the ground like the Congress did. Being a Modi supporter I always believed that Modi is doing grate thing for our future. But from past 6 months show different result and different future. Modi made Black money go away as he promised but in process of making policy of making black money harder, he just made making black money a legal and tax paying. Due to the policy other people were Abel to increase profits margins which eventually lead to high rate of products and an increase in dearness. Now due to GST and other policies all the product are almost double in price. Yes, that's the Gujarat model. More money reaches up, less remains for down guys Is 'systemic' appropriate in this case? Isn't it supposed to be more of a biological/medical term? 

Can some vocabulary nazis help out ? I think Modi is doing good job and people know that and appreciates him and thus is voting more and more BJP.

#AccheDinForeva I would happily blame PM Modi for this but corruption has been the system in developing world long before he got the top job. He is making both corruption and genocides systematic  [removed] But....He is making Sardar Patel and Lord Ram statues. He is doing things as per kulcha.

If taxation is tight, how much of funding will benami attract?

When we start using percentage without evidence, it is as good as sensationalizing. 0.001% of 1 Billion population is 10 million population. Is that less or more? Do you expect all people in the country to be equally rich? or poor? 

 Accha bhai sahab, aap India main hi janaam liye hain na? Corruption has always been systemic in India.  [removed] i nearly read all comments

689,Business/Finance,"Just want to add to the discussion here. I'm a 2018 pass out from one of the new IIM's (set up in 2011) and the picture is not too rosy. If you have expectations of a 12lpa+ package after graduating from an IIM, there are only a few (about 30% of the batch) who have got that.  Placements are very shady and often students are forced to apply to companies which are not even heard of. Our placement process started in Nov, and there are still double digit students left to be placed with our convocation soon.

On the plus side, there is a lot to learn from studying in top 20 B-schools as the alumni interaction and pedagogy is good. All I'm emphasizing on is that the immediate reward of an extremely good job in terms of ROI and role is non-existent in the newer IIM's. What are the top 25 institutions? Seeing the state of top mba colleges ,I'd say top 20 are best. Other than that ,it's useless doing an MBA 

Many of my friends did engineering then immediately mba and now earning 6-7-8 lakhs per annum after spending 6 lakhs for two years ,doesn't make any fucking sense RoI, and brand name play a major role when it comes to do an MBA. I agree with OP to the point that this case of high competition, rat race and missed opportunities exists even among top 10 colleges of the country. Thus, if you are planning to do an MBA, go ahead only if it suits your profile or your expected career progression, and not just because everyone is doing it.  Thanks for posting this - people need to know the kind of fraud MBA education is in many colleges. 

My friend was the secretary of the owner of some private institutions who owned some B and C grade schools and colleges. They decided to start an MBA college and built one fancy looking building within another campus of their college. They were not affiliated with anyone and offered a post-graduate diploma in something-something-MBA. (Note that they are not affiliated to anyone and this diploma is just a worthless piece of paper).

They were having a tough time attracting candidates and one day the CEO asked my friend, her secretary to go and find out what the issue was. He went there during the admission seasons and also joined in with the supporting staff. He managed to convince 12 students to join the institute. The CEO immediately made him the Admission officer for the institute. The next year, the second batch under him got 32 admissions.

The fees in the first year was 8 lakhs and the second year had been hiked to 10 lakhs! 

(After the 2nd year, my friend requested a ""transfer"" to an engineering college so that he wouldn't feel guilty about how he was literally cheating people to do an ""MBA"" that had no value at all.) Where did you do your MBA from, OP? Is Christ University Bangalore any good ? How would you rate the Indian School of Business? CAT 18 aspirant here(not serious as per now), currently studying in an average engineering college. 

80% chances that I will be placed in a mass recruiting company. 

MS from abroad or MBA from India, as a fresher.? Don't downvote, ik both of them are completely different but my aim is to get a good package and a better life (the reason abroad). I belong from a middle class family but parents are ready to spend around 40lakhs for education. Hows fore and symbiosis? Which was your MBA institution?  [deleted] How's SCMHRD? Asking for my sister who's planning to do MBA this year  Just a clarification, what constitutes top 25 though?

Rankings in India are very different in different systems. I'd say the Old IIMs come first, then MDI, XLRI, FMS, IIFT & SPJIMR. Some IITs are also in the top 25. Any particular list to follow? You can read this article .....

Important Details and Information about CAT 2018 Exam Can anyone tell me the scope of doing MBA in Human Resource Management from XLRI or TISS? Is it worth it? There's nothing new that you have shared in this post ",1521210986.0,1,81,0,59,"I am 2013 MBA pass out. 

I am surprised to see so much misplaced expectations and ignorance among MBA aspirants.

I am currently working as a researcher at a think tank that evaluates quality of management education.

So, according to me, here is some general gyan -

Unless you are from top 25 B School in India, your MBA / PGDM is absolutely worthless job wise.

Private B Schools ranked outside rank 25, are only interested in your ""money"". 

Students joining outside 25 rank Private B Schools will face these hardships -

(1) Placement process will be non-transparent, skewed to benefit favorites of the institute, very few good companies.

(2) Lack of summer placements. 

(3) Some even fudge their placement figures.

(4) Average salary declared is almost always untrue.

(5) 100% placement never happens.

(6) Favoritism based on chamcha giri is rampant, you will get better grades/placement based on that.

(7) You will come across relatives or friends of the founder of the private B School posing as ""Faculty"". 

(8) Alumni networking will be non-existent. 

Also, Business Analytics is a new MBA major specialization being offered with traditional Finance/Marketing/HR. 

It makes sense to opt this from job perspective.",Some Gyan for aspiring MBA students about which no one will bother to talk
690,Business/Finance,"I know multiple people with MBAs and PhDs who did an LLB in their 30s and 40s to start consultancies in various business related fields. None of them are practising lawyers but doing the course opened a lot of doors in terms of career opportunities. It adds a lot to your profile, depending on what field you're trying to enter. Benefits greatly in finance, investing and startup entrepreneurship consulting.

IMO it's a great move. Luckily for your friend, this is the first year that CLAT has no age limit after the supreme court made a verdict that said so. He might have to get used to all other students being half his age! lol On a slightly different note. Such a question would've been unthinkable in a developed country. This is one area I'm genuinely envious of. There should be no prejudice about age when it comes to learning. 

I hope he does go ahead and studies. We don't have enough people actually willing to study.  > IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam

IITs have Law programs too, now ? I did llb around 10 yrs back, not practicing. I had a classmate 60+, only reason he did was because he wanted to ""learn more"". Very nice person, he once fought with traffic police as his car was towed from legal parking area. Traffic constable brought back his car, and said sorry to him. 

Llb 3 years course is for those holding graduation. 5 years for 12 pass. Attending classes is compulsory if you are in good college and no one cares in many others, I had 4% in my second year. So attending evening or full time should consider the college he gets admitted too.

While studying and reading the cases is very interesting, practicing would mean spending many years with zero to very low income. Many of my friend still makes less than 10k a month. This is where top law school matters. If you are graduate of such place then getting into good law firms get easy.

I believe everyone should do Llb. No matter what you do it helps to know the law. DU law admits people only upto 30 years of age

Not sure about the IIT it doesnt have a great rep though, a law school needs years of establishment to have good faculties. Most of what Ive heard about IIT law course was the teaching is terrible  If he has ample financial reserves in the form of alternative income/rent/ancestral property, it can be a very good option. Only the very few in India can truly dedicate themselves to litigation without running after money. On the other hand if you think of making money from Law after entering it at age 36, you are likely to be disappointed.

Easy and quick money in Law is only in Transactional Law (i.e. drafting up agreements/affidavits/documents and registering them etc.) and in consultancy/advisory (eg: being on a businessman's negotiating team while he/they negotiate an agreement/merger/tie-up with a potential partner).. Transactional practice can be independent/self-employed as well, infact most low-level low-skilled independent lawyers make money through drafting agreements of leave and license, rather than appearing before a Court. You can make 30-35 K per month from drafting rent agreements and affidavits, you can barely hope to make 15 K per month from fighting cases in court. Even the better known Law Firms in Mumbai do not offer their freshers 30-35 K p.m. as starting salary.

An area in Litigation is indeed profitable but it is cornered by the niche profession of **Solicitor Firms.**   Few solicitor firms will agree to recruit someone at 36 years of age. 

The best thing is someone who owns huge profitable land/rent independently practising Law in the Courts, i.e. actually pleading before a Court. Thats how the profession used to be in Pre-Independence India. Why should there be any age limit to study. Ageism is part of casteism. I guess, there is no age limit for learning.

*For preparation of CLAT, u may suggest this free CLAT mock test site - https://www.cybermocktest.com/clat/*  If he already has masters degree why doesn't he just take a NET exam and teach? Law undergrad student from NLU Patiala, here.

I’m sure your friend has a graduation degree, so I will not suggest going for CLAT, since it is particularly for a 5 year course which is integrated course pursued by students after their 12th. The variants of these courses depending upon the NLU are BA. LL.B(hon), B.Sc. LLB, BBA LLB. etc.
5 years for a course is too much, when he can successfully pursue a 3years LL.B. degree. I will suggest checking out BVP Pune, BHU, etc.
It’s a much better utilisations of his time and resources too, given that a five-year course is very intensive with compulsory attendance and 2 lacs in fees in a year (approx.) if you consider the NLUs and other top colleges.

I would recommend a 3year course from a reputed state university over 5 year course through CLAT.
 Never too late for education and starting afresh aiming for a goal.


He'd just need to keep the eligibility criterias in check. May I know which city your friend is based out of?  In my time at law school, I have seen 40-50 somethings sitting with us 20 year old kids. 

Good thing about law is, it doesn't have age limits and or any retirement age. Some state bar councils do have 45 year age limit, I am not sure if it was challenged in court, but that's a non-issue. 

It can be a task to learn nuances and practicalities of legal practice when you're 30 plus but it's not a challenge big enough to be a roadblock for him to take up law.

Best of luck to your friend  I study in a CLAT affiliated institute. We have never had anyone his age study here. Thats because CLAT institutions don't have a 3 year LLB course. We only have a 5 year BA LLB course or a BBA LLB course. So he'll have to shift to another city for 5 years and go to class everyday with 17-18 year olds. Ask him not to give clat and research about colleges which give the LLB degree alone. For that, he should already have 
a graduate degree like BA, BSc or BBA. Many factors need to considered:


He will feel the age gap a lot, especially if in a 5 year program but also in some 3 year programs since many students join straight after college. The exception to this is probably DU and GLC, mumbai. The reason for that is attendance is not an issue and DU still has evening batches. These attract older candidates who are working during the day and also UPSC aspirants who have law as a back up. Your friend will find it easier to gel with the crowd at such places. 


Your friend might be able to continue working while studying. Even more so if it’s a teaching job and it’s part time. Those can be kind of chill and he is already working there, so cancer-based discrimination may be low. 


Regarding placements: HR recruiters will want cheap workers with no baggage. Hence, ageism crops up. Law schools (all colleges for that matter) are factories and unfortunately, your friend will be an outlier. He is highly experienced in diverse fields. This is bad and good. Recruiters won’t know what to do with him or he will get a offer appropriate for a 21 year old. It can be good if he finds a job that values his experience in B.Tech, MBA etc but that takes a lot of hustling to find. Yet he will have to explain 4 years of unemployment. Truth is, his classmates will be safer bets and his getting recruited through the formal placement process will be tough. 


Litigation stream is always an option. It’s slow work in the beginning but he’d be self employed or in a small firm.


Him being a cancer-survivor, if I were in his shoes, I’d opt for a college with chill attendance, continue with the teaching. Write the LLB exams. Build up contingencies for a cancer relapse (good insurance, access to healthcare, savings). Then carry on with life with the above priority (job with health benefits, low stress) and try to be happy. 

TLDR: technically, age is no barrier. Still, it’ll be tough. He should consider part-time and retain his day job. It is doable. Cancer changes everything. Relapse is a risk that he will have to mitigate always. [deleted] ",1521812763.0,1,67,0,72,"Hi,

A big thank you to all good Samaritans of r/India for their advice and feedback.

My friend has given me access to this reddit account after seeing the response.

I experienced outright rejection during my recent MBA entry level job interviews due to my situation.

I was depressed, angry and confused about my future.

I was very skeptical if r/India could really help me out with my situation.

Law graduates of r/India, Please share your views on this :

My close friend is a cancer survivor.

He is 36 years old. 

He has these two career options in mind -

(1) Whether he should get back into IT industry as he has 4.5 year's of coding experience in C#. If yes, what steps.

and

(2) Whether to pursue law as his MBA Finance has given him good exposure to Mergers And Acquisitions (M&A),  Business laws and Taxation.

I am asking your help/advice/suggestion for Query No (2) i.e, He wants to study law at the age of 36 years.

He is appearing for these law exams in 2018 -

CLAT, IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam and DU LLB exam.

He says that there is no age limit for studying law and practicing law. 

Is there any merit to it ? (I don't know anything about careers after law education.)

His family supports him wholeheartedly, but they need clarity on how exactly can pursuing LLB law education help my friend at the age of 36.

Please, Please upvote for visibility.

Edit:

Being a cancer survivor, my friend was unemployed close to 3-4 years during his cancer treatment.

Recently, he secured a part time decent teaching job that can become full time.

His family is unhappy that he will resign from his present job, which he secured through lots of effort against all odds.

So, Is there any merit in his decision to take up law education at this age.","Law graduates of r/India, My close friend (cancer survivor), plans to do LLB this year. He is 36 years old. Is there any merit to his decision ?"

(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ Regarding the high crime rate in kerala: 

https://youtu.be/2EH6OWMUCnI

You may skip to 3:45 Every state has dependence on something. I just think that Kerala does the right things with their money. The risk associated with this source is questionable but the money itself is used in improving HDI and not just 'bijness' related indicators.

Their economy and employment is dependent on three things mainly - tourism, gelf and Bangalore. Maybe their next target itself is to reduce this dependency.

The debate is very nuanced with guys like Bhagwati and Sen arguing the merits of Gujarat and Kerala models. With economics, there are no right answers. It's just whatever works.

Now let's take the other extreme - Haryana. The economic indicators are off the charts. But people still hold onto their outdated beliefs and some parts of the state also has law and order problems and is regarded unsafe for women. Now is this development and is it sustainable? >Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. 

And why was so UP being in Ganga belt had historically been a rich place of poor people . Kerala had better indicator at independence bcoz it had  and has better society . And still today UP is a highly divided society .


For Japanese miracle and their industrialization , their homogeneity and social structure played an important foundation part  As a Keralite, I find the chest thumping to be a ridiculous show-off at best and the communist revisionism to hijack all the achievements at the worst. We will be facing dire issues when the middle-east slows down significantly. I personally know so many young men pinning their futures on some small job in the gulf. 

Trade unions must be reigned in and the ease of doing business has to improve. It won't happen overnight, but that will be the greatest thing the current left government can do and only a left government can do.

I really wish there was a way for me to return to my hometown. As of now, the only way I can sustain my current income if I move back is to go freelance, and that is being optimistic. To be fair, a govt can do investment in social welfare without being communist. Just look at what Mamata Banerjee is doing in Bengal, despite me hating her, she has done some good work in mgnrega, improving the hospitals from their dismayl state, and overall improving rural infrastructure. 

The fiscal deficit and high debt you mentioned was common in communist govt of Bengal too. When the Left left, we had a high debt of over 1.5 lakh crore, and the current govt is not doing anything either to reign it. 

My main issue with Kerala model is that it can't be implemented anywhere else. It works for them, good, but we need some other way to lift other states. I like breaking big states to smaller, and then working on them. Likewise, we can produce replicas of Goa which have decent social infrastructure as well as good enough ease of doing business to lift people up.  One of the less spoken advantages of Kerala is that most of its population is either in the cities or live in close proximity to cities. I believe factors like high HDI and low IMR are because of this. 

But regardless of what brought about its high development, I think the Kerala model cannot be adopted by rest of the states. If we are looking to emulate, I guess the Tamil Nadu model of socialism has proven successful. TN may not be Kerala, but is often #2 or #3 on most counts. Again, one advantage that TN has/had that a state like UP does not is that Madras has been a prominent administration city since pre-independence. But I think any benefits from that are minimal at the moment.  Radicalization is a problem in Islam itself. I don't think the rates of radicalization are more in kerala in comparison to an equivalent Muslim population of that number elsewhere.  Do you have a source for this? While OP is raising legitimate points about Kerala’s economy, you seem to be missing the whole point about Kerala model. 

Kerala model is that It has achieved very high material Quality of life/human development indicators, despite being A low income state.

The reason it is called a model is because it is unique. Pretty much everywhere else in the world economic growth and quality of life or Human development go hand-in-hand but strangely Kerala Managed to improve material quality of life with little economic growth.

By arguing that Kerala’s economic growth track record may be considered abysmal, though a fair point, you are only reinforcing the concept of Kerala model.

Nobody calls Kerala an economic miracle, everybody knows it is not. 

Is it a replicatable model? Maybe not. Is it the key to solving the problems across the country? Definitely doesn’t seem like it. 

Has historic circumstances contributed? Perhaps. But historic and geographic reasons also limits its economic potential too. So that is argument that cuts both ways. 

Now, i would say it is facetious to argue that the outcomes have solely been due to the gulf boom, Because the impact of the gulf boom on Kerala really began only in the late 80s. 

Kerala Declared hundred percent literacy in the early 90s, which would not have been possible without strong government policies over the years. 

Also some of the places with most gulf NRIs, such as Malappuram, are actually some of the most backward areas in Kerala.  


And to give credit to the Travancore royal family is laughable, because if that were the case then many regions in Southern Tamil Nadu today was part of the  erstwhile Travancore kingdom. While, parts of the Travancore kingdom that is in Kerala have done extremely well, parts that are with Tamil Nadu have yet to catch up. Also Travancore kingdom is probably covered less than 30% of modern Kerala. 

It is very clear that the most significant government policy that laid the foundation for this transformation was the massive wealth redistribution program launched by the first Kerala government, which was a communist government. 

So, what has the Kerla model achieved? Fewer children are dying, fewer mothers are dying, there are fewer illiterate people. More and more people are getting skilled, hence are able to find higher paying jobs, albeit, elsewhere. I would argue that we are yet to yield dividends of Kerala model. 

So, yes it is a model. Is it the best model? it is hard to say. Has it its own advantages? Oh yes definitely. 
 The riot cases are high because almost everything is registered and reported.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokku_kooli

One of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard of. *Upvotes*

*Grabs popcorn*

**Let the games begin.** I think best things that happened to Kerala were, Progressive Travancore state, Early Communist government and lots of christian missionaries.

Christian missionaries and Progressive Travancore state meant that the state had a robust education system. providing for a progressive and good labor base for development. 

Communist govt took land from absentee landlords and redistributed land among landless laborers. Also, brought social parity by working against caste system. Social parity is very much a prerequisite for economic growth. Kerala achieved is much earlier than others.

State couldn't take full advantage of it's lead, but remittances or not, it did have a headstart on other states in early independence days. > 2. Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foreign jobs, the state’s unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.

True. But like @i_hate_circlejerk and many others have mentioned, there is an aversion to blue collar work in Kerala. It's not because of the unavailability of jobs. It's not the best feature to have, but this happens in most emancipated societies. This is more of an issue of how daily wage work is seen from a societal perspective.  > merits & sustainability of the Kerala model

Seems to more Kerala thrashing than anything else. Don't see too many merits mentioned :) Kerala has a lot of things going for it, and I'd rather be here than anywhere else in India. But it has its own challenges as well, just like any other state.

What Malayalis should do is to not gloat too much about how they are better that this or that state in India, but really look at where they are falling short.

The reality is that if the gulf money dries up, Kerala is fucked. Either produce capital and expertise in the state, or leave your beautiful homeland to work in possibly unfriendly places for those who have it.  Why so much unemployment in kerala?  [deleted] > Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%.

And that 47% started off from 0, thanks to Kerala's proclivity to open up and mix with other cultures. The various social reformation movements, and influx of Christian missionaries among many other factors contributed to this. Who claimed it was all post-independence Govts? The EMS Govt. though, made giant strides in post-independence Kerala through it's [education bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Education_Act_1958_(Act_6_of_1959)) - it's not _all_ post independence, but a _lot_ _was_ post independence

>  Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foreign jobs, the state’s unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.

It's not the best feature to have, but this happens in most emancipated societies. This is more of an issue of how daily wage work is seen from a societal perspective. 

>  Political Violence

Violence is never a good thing, but Political violence is slightly different. Political awareness among a population is generally considered to be a prime metric in considering the collective intelligence and societal emancipation of a region. In Kerala, political awareness is super high. This is often misused by parties, but political killings like what the BJP (RSS) have been spreading, are super low. The only political killings that do happen in Kerala are always RSS - CPI (M), in North Kerala. While these are highly condemnable, they are exceedingly rare.

And also, **crime metrics are reported and recorded much more stringently in Kerala, thanks to a well functioning executive**. You might remember a report about how Scandinavia had reported extreme high cases of sexual assault. Similar situation (though high influx of migrants is also a problem there).

> Hotbed for ISIS recruitement

This seems to be the most ridiculous of them all. Almost right out of the RSS playbook. Quoting the exact same article you've quoted: 

> India’s Muslim population, the third largest in the world, has so far contributed negligible numbers to Isis – fewer than 90 people, according to most estimates. “More have gone from Britain, even from the Maldives, than India,” 

Sure, Wahhabism is a growing threat in Kerala, and more and more muslims seem to be drawn to it. But the absolute numbers here are abysmally small and can't really be considered a metric at all.


> And finally, the extreme dependence on remittances

Remittances undeniably drive a bulk of Kerala's economy. You've provided good numbers, sure. What is your point though? Agriculture and brain drain might be flipsides to it, but comparing to other states that _do_ depend on Agriculture, isn't it better that people are employed abroad and are bringing money into the economy rather than flail about in abject poverty? It is funding a flourishing society, and Malayalis have built up vast business empires abroad. And are employing thousands of Indians.

According to this logic, all of the IT engineers flocking to Bangalore, are bad for the nation, because they should be doing Agriculture, and not depend on the US for offshore development projects.

 Thanks OP. As a Keralite, I felt that the whole Kerala-is-best circlejerk on randia was getting out of hand. This was sorely needed.

 3;really? lot of repetitive points.. sanghis are putting in lot of effort in researching about Kerala these days.. such sincere hardwork should be appreciated.. but cherry picking facts to peddle some agenda is not right

you can't judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree

very high population density is not suitable for manufacturing & related jobs.

Huge pressure on land means less agricultural output & heavy dependence on imports

> extreme dependence on remittances

are you trying to spin this off as some sort of insult? it's not because it means human resource is the biggest asset of Kerala.

All these people went through the hurdles of getting a passport & visa in a country where millions can't even read or write. [removed] 1. We have always been more progressive than the rest of the country. That is not a negative mark.

2. We have the low-pay jobs the rest of India counts as employment. We just leave those to out-of-state workers. We do indeed have a problem with not having the a sufficient number of higher end jobs as compared to our output of graduates. This point of yours is partially legitimate.

3. Sweden is the rape capital of the world. /s

4. We do business by the book. There is less bribery and more regulation; that makes things harder.

1. Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. To claim that Kerala is high on HDI purely from post-independence governments is a bit of a stretch; they started out with a relatively compact population (13.5m in 1951) and the most advantages among states, thanks to the focus on education by the local dynastic precursors, the Travancore Family, along with contributions with subgroups like the Nair Society and Christian Missionaries.

",The Kerala Model
692,Business/Finance,"Wow. TLDR? Wow what a nice read. But there was no mention of famines or partitions. Were they not back-breaking for the economy? [deleted] I don't think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an ""evil"" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they've committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  

IMHO, he's raising awareness about the atrocities that they've committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor's main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in 'India Unbound'. But I don't think it really contradicts Tharoor's claims . Everyone of Das' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding ""India"" back but he let's the Brits go Scott free.

Yes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a ""Indian"" structural head who could've changed things or we could've had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. 

The drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the ""gifts"" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb's tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad's Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could've been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn't be as poor as we are now.

A book came out last year called ""Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830"" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. 

He makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans’ awareness of the Company’s conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and “despotic” empire . Following the Revolution, America’s connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods. 
 >It gave India almost a hundered years of peace. 

I'm done. I wouldn't call 100+ of looting and injustice ""peaceful."" Have read the whole thing.
The Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.

Taking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.

This they did by creating:
Low literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you'll fail to compete.)

Unstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn't moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn't these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980's they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can't deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn't right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let's just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.

Personally I'm glad for stuff like outlawing Sati and reforming personal laws which I'm sure most of our post independence governments wouldn't have the guts to touch. Was India ever a rich nation in the first place? People use the 27% of world GDP stat to justify the label but we had 27% of the world population also at that time. 

Both Shashi Tharoor and Gurcharan Das are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation.  Slightly off topic, but I believe much of Tharoor's British bashing is just shrewd political posturing. When he first ran for parliament in 2009, the Nair community voted for him en masse because ""he is one of us"". The educated/liberal class voted for him because he had the ""it"" factor, undersecretary general of the UN, erudite, sophisticated etc. He won handily, with a huge margin. In 2014, a lot of the older Nairs voted BJP because ""they stand for Hindu values"" (evidence for this is anectodal, everyone in my (+wife's) family voted Tharoor in 2009, most of our parents' generation voted BJP in 2014). Tharoor still had the youth/liberal vote and won, but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009. A huge slide. In 2019, he faces the prospect of running against Suresh Gopi (popular actor, current BJP RS MP), and stands a real risk of losing. I consider his anti-Brit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowd.

It is really simplistic to claim Britain ""looted"" us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of India's wealth was concentrated in the hands of Zamindars, Nawabs and Rajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the Indian sub-continent before the British brought it all together. Well Tharoor is not completely wrong either. India was rich, maybe not as rich as all those WhatsApp forwards mention like 27% of world GDP and other crap. I also believe that Tharoor's fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches. I think he's going to use this wave of false patriotism that's been around which makes people patriots on social media, to his advantage in the next elections. I mean - no one really discusses if a robbery is ""overall a good thing"" even if it did help turn someone's life around in a positive way.  > The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

As I've been trying to explain to the languagetards on all sides, accepting English IS decolonization. Glad to see an academic agree. I can drink his urine straight from source Brilliant. Learned a lot about myself and my country...  Brilliant article. Its important to see good arguments from both sides. Thanks for sharing.

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.


",TL;DR – Godman to Tycoon – The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev
693,Business/Finance,"Dude, thank you. This was really good. When you mentioned in that thread I knew I'd never read the book but I did want to know a gist.  [OP that delivers is the best kind of OP](http://i.imgur.com/Tyu0M4y.jpg).

PS, Author's take on this book:

> [I’d be Naive Not to Worry About a Fallout](https://www.thequint.com/books/2017/07/31/priyanka-pathak-narain-author-of-explosive-ramdev-biography)

Really good interview.  >Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR.

Ramdev is a shady dude Thanks. I had pre-ordered the book on Amazon the day it became available, but it hasn't yet reached me. I learned about the ebook on Juggernaut from your post and got a copy. I'm more than halfway through the book now, this guy is no swami, he's not even a hard nosed businessman, he's a mobster.

**Edit:** Finished the book a while back, thought I should update. Took less than three hours to read, was interesting enough to read in one sitting. Not badly written at all, saw the author went to Columbia to study journalism, it shows in the tight narrative and objective stance. It's clear that the author wanted to cover the less seen perspective, which makes this more of an investigative journalism piece than a biography. It's taken some effort to put this all together, but it's not a multi year ground breaking effort. Nevertheless very timely, and shows the murky underbelly. Lala Ramdev is incredibly ambitious, and since ambition is violence, he's quite ruthless and violent. It's a psych profile [probably true for many CEOs and top politicians who have all been found to have psychopathic tendencies.] (http://time.com/32647/which-professions-have-the-most-psychopaths-the-fewest/)

It's a rags to riches story of ruthless ambition. Also an example of what yoga without yama/niyama (dos and don'ts) can do, it can provide incredible energy for mischief. Even before reading this, I never trusted in Ramdev as a spiritual godman, but still didn't actively disapprove of him since I just considered him to be a businessman.
But reading your post has made me realize that he is a pretty terrible human being who feeds off the faith of the gullible.

Thanks for the post mate. You have completely changed my perception.

TL;DR. ""New shit has come to light."" I do not know the truth behind the facts presented in that book but based on what you have written it seems that this Baba knows how to gain people's trust and then punishes them for trusting him. In a way he is teaching them all a lesson for trusting him by exploiting their weaknesses.

For example, Shankar Dev and Karamveer seem to have had very high ideals and when they wanted to hand pick somebody to carry on their legacy out of all the people they chose Ramdev. It shows that these people were terrible at judging who is a real disciple and who is not. This is fucking scary man... Fuck! OP, this is great. I had always known there was something behind Rajeev Dixit's death. 

Just like he says to boycott Chinese goods, I think we should all boycott Patanjali goods.  Gangs of Wasseypur wali feeling aati hai story padh kar.

This is scary AF side of this FMCG empire.
 So as expected, this baba is nothing but a fraud who built his empire on top of lies, deceit and murders.

Thank you OP. Somebody need to make a hindi TLDR. thanks for the summary, was looking for a kindle version and couldn't find. great that you pointed to the app by Juggernaut. MF businessman. Now no buying of his products. Future Anurag Kashyap movie.  top class post.  one of the coolest reads Someone should make a series like narcos on him. I want baba ramdev mobile phone all made with haridwar hardware. Ecologically friendly and swadeshi. Any proofs in the book..? Great job OP and nice summary. You have already done good work but if you added the timeline it will be more helpful in keeping things into perspective. 

Though not surprising at all there are a few interesting tidbits here and there. As you said

>His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon.

This is such a shame. Wonderful write up. Thanks for your efforts  Great job OP. Thanks a lot for spreading the light. You're making randia great again. 😂 OP is this book available in Hindi ? Good concise write up. Good job OP. Thank you. 👍👌 Movie banao koi iski life pe Bisi  Ramdev killed Dixit? Big fan of the baba now. Good read, thank you OP for your Quality contributions. As long as people believe these Godmans blindly they will milk them as much as possible.  Mine=blown gonna drop my career and become a baba now We know most of the baba ramdev products are shit. But why they are still popular ? They are very cheap for a normal lower middle class man. His advertisments reach common lower middle class man reliably well. Where as same cheap products are sold double the price abroad like in USA and uk. Soon his products will find high end price across the globe. Does it mean, anyone with specialized skill can grow to this level? Why anyone hasn't done? 

What do you think Ramdev baba will do with this amassed wealth? 

Karma always works, looks what is happening with Sonia and Rahul?

Are you guys feeling happy with existing FMCG products like Maggie, why not crib about it?

In India, there are enough people who are jealous about other's prosperity, indeed you can find them here too.

fellas take chill and learn from good things.

 Haters gonna hate. But going rags to riches like this ain't no joke ",1502098509.0,1,95,0,549,"Context – Yesterday in a thread I happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a TL;DR of the book once I am finished. 

On the onset if you have the time and resources, I would highly recommend reading the book. It’s published by Juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at Rs. 80. I have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. This is one of few good biographies I have read, partly due to the Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (Baba Ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. It took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. The author – Priyanka Pathak Narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for Mint and that is where she begins on this journey. As part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including Balakrishna – Ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. 

So here we go

* Baba Ramdev (Ram Kisan Yadav) was born in Said Alipur in a poor farming family. A sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. 

* Somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of Arya Samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. He joined Khanpur gurukul where he learnt Sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be Acharya Balakrishna

* Balakrishna is quite into Ayurveda and is from Haridwar where he befriends **Acharya Karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken Arya Samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in Yoga, Indian Philosophy and Vedas. Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna under his wing and soon Ramdev joins them after a controversy.

* Ramdev learns yoga from Karamveer. To propagate Yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **Shankar Dev**, a patron of Kripalu Bagh Ashram at Haridwar. Shankar Dev wants and only trusts Karamveer. But since he is Arya Samaj member he is not just ready to take Sanyas. Sensing an opportunity, Ramdev steps in. Taking Sanyas means two things -  1) He can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) He cannot maintain any material wealth. I am bringing this up of course because this is very important

* Balakrishna meanwhile sets up Divya Pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, Swami Yogananda. Balakrishna himself from **Nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport.

* In early 2000s, Aastha and Sanskar become household name. The TV guys select Ramdev over Karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **An interesting story here is that after Aastha turned Ramdev down, our diligent Baba went to Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh for a twenty minute slot.** This is also where I learnt that channels like Sanskar and Aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for TV slots to demonstrate their abilities

* We all now know the story. Ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship 

* Soon Ramdev has friends at high places. **Mulayam Singh, ND Tiwari from Congress, Sudarshan Agarwal – ex UP governor.** So when they are charged with Sales Tax fraud, Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure on Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner to drop the case and retire.

* Ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. His younger brother Ram Bharat is soon in charge of the finances. This causes rift between Karamveer and Ramdev. Afterall Ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. So one day, Karamveer just walks out. 

* Swami Yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of Divya Pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **Soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** The neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. 

* Enter Rajeev Dixit.  A swadeshi and founder of Azadi Bachao Andolan. Ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat

* Meanwhile, his political favors with the Congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of Food Processing Plants. But soon, due to not paying workers at Divya Pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of CITU. Brinda Karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. Apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. Though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the Union Health Ministries’ Ayurvedic unit – AYUSH confirmed traces of human and animal DNA. Karat apparently met N.D Tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action

* Soon Ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is born over the controversial Divya Pharmacy. And here we see the next mystery. The disappearance of 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev (Ramdev’s Guru). Mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of Ramdev and his deputies. Police find nothing but a note in his room saying “I have taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot pay it. Please forgive me. I am leaving”. Ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. 

* Ramdev and Rajeev Dixit set up a new party – **Bharat Swabhiman Andolan.** 

* The Takeover of Aastha – When SEBI freezes 93% of Aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity Ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. The installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to Ramdev. Part of this was done in faith. Once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, Ramdev bullies the owner and MD into resignation. Meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy Sanskar channel for him. Which that follower did.

* As mentioned earlier, keeping inline with Ramdev’s political ambitions, Rajeev Dixit and Ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat. Soon, Rajeev Dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. The hospital said it was cardiac arrest. Ramdev said on television that he had told Rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, BP and heart disease. But Rajeev’s brother Pradeep says that he had no such health problems. Next, Ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in Haridwar as Dixit was son of the soil instead of his native Wardha. But as his body was laid for public demonstration, the Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers were stunned. Dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. His skin was peeling strangely. There was black, blue blood coming from his nose. Soon there was hue and cry. The Andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. Ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **Hindu Dharma.** When they refused to budge, Ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘Some people have come from Mumbai. They want me to do a post mortem. Such cutting is against Hindu Dharma’. Soon Ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats.

* Ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the Anna movement. He wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. Hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger Lokpal bill, Ramdev was more about bringing black money back. So he sat on a fast onto death protest. Meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior Congress members (Pranab Mukerjee, P.K Bansal, Kapil Sibal and Subodh Kant Sahay). He then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. This ired the Congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. Ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez**

* Part of the credit towards the success of Patanjali should go to their ex-CEO – **S.K Patra**. He helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. Patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on Ramdev’s business enterprises by the Congress Govt. But soon Patra’s influence once again made Balakrishna and Ram Bharat uneasy. Patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with Baba. 

* Today Patanjali is the second largest FMCG company with revenue of **Rs 10561 crores**. Its best selling products are ghee – **Rs 1467 crore**, Dant Kanti toothpaste – Rs 940 crore. But Patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. Caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - [Link](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/patanjalis-desi-cow-ghee-even-cow-ghee)

* Part of the reason for Patanjali’s market share is its price. Its below market as Baba believes only in taking a marginal share. But this is also possible because working at Patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. Economic Times has published a transcript from the book on this section – [Link](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/inside-patanjali-heres-what-life-is-like-in-baba-ramdevs-company/articleshow/59824892.cms) 

* There are a number of violations flagged by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) including license number fraudulence on Patanjali noodles. A lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units.

Ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. He has no doubt helped popularize Yoga and Ayurveda in India. The people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. His target is to get Patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. And under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. 

Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR. But its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. Hence once again would recommend reading the book.

Edit 1: Formatting

Edit 2: Woah! Thanks for the Gold kind stranger. Though I would rather have people reading the book. While Indian non fiction writing and publishing are much to be desired, ventures like these must be encouraged. That will allow us to see similar good books that talk about interesting men, policies, events etc. ",I find R/India circlejerking too much over Shashi Tharoor whenever he reproaches the evils of the British Raj.

Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",We really need to talk about Flairs.

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired.

Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ?

###Scumbag journalist: 

###Writes article saying ""Do the math"". Does no math.

**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**

A look at the JP¥ - IN₹ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ₹0.6 for JP¥1, for the most part. Here's a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. 

While Japan's Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India's inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).

The author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India's inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan's inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.

>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.

Has the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. 

###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here's the actual math:

We are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.

Since the author is concerned with exchange rates, that's JP¥ 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ₹ 1.09 trillion. 

^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¥ 1.892 tr and ₹ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)

Over 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¥ 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ₹ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ₹ 1.43 trillion. That's *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.

So effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**

###Now here's where the author's argument (and lack of math) is turned on its' head:

Assuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¥ 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren't losing anything but time. That's great for them.

But seeing how India's inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ₹ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn't translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. 

###Still don't get it? Okay try this: 

Here's a real-life example using real data from the past:

* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)
* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Let's forget the 'trillions' for simplicity.

Say your Grandpa took a loan of JP¥ 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ₹ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¥ 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ₹ 1,156.00.

Now, back in Grandpa's day, ₹ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ₹ 100. In 1967, ₹ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ₹ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year's salary**, back then. Today, ₹ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ₹ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ₹ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ₹ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ₹ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Meanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¥ 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its' 1967 value ([worth about JP¥ 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.

So your Grandpa paid off a month's rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that's why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.

Now obviously, if the author is right, and Japan's inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won't lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn't go absolutely berserk. 

###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ₹ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ₹ 0.326 Trillion (in today's terms). 

^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¥ - IN₹ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)

This is because ₹ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. 

Put another way, if we take ₹ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that's impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our 'loan' of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

If you're using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ₹ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)

So... take this loan of ₹ 1.09 trillion, and put ₹ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ₹ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it's effectively free. 

Now, mind you, we aren't getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.

Yes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa's ₹ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don't want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big 'loan'.

This, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation. Because otherwise, sitting in a bank account, your money is actually **losing** value over time.

>Initially, each high speed train will have 10 cars and the capacity to accommodate 750 people, The Times of India said. It will increase to 16 cars that will accommodate 1,200 people.

>According to initial estimates, around 1.6 crore people are expected to travel by the bullet train annually. By 2050, around 1.6 lakh commuters should travel by the high-speed train on a daily basis.

> The fares could be in the range of Rs 3000 - Rs 5,000.

^(Source - http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mostly-elevated-partly-under-sea-all-you-need-to-know-about-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train/story-nzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7N.html)

They want to complete it in 5-6 years, but let's be conservative and just give it 10 years. Let's assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ₹ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.

The article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that's 44,000 people per day), but that it'll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn't something that can increase exponentially, we'll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.


    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years
    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years
    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.

Basically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).

So averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That's 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. 

    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.

1,471,680,000 passengers total: that's **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ₹ 3000? 

###That gives us a total revenue collection of ₹ 4.415 Trillion. 

Let's assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ₹ 3.09 Trillion. 

[Operational costs will be around ₹ 412 cr (₹ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ₹ 164.8 billion over 40 years. 

That leaves us with ₹ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

**That leaves a cool ₹ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**

###Wait, what?! 

*You're telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ₹ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* 

I dunno! Let's check: 

* 1.471 billion trips * ₹ 1500 = ₹ 2.2075 Trillion. 
* *STILL* assume just 75% occupancy: ₹ 1.656 Trillion.
* Deducting the operational costs leaves: ₹ 1.491 Trillion. 

Hot *damn*, we can pay for the train using just ticket collection, even if we price the tickets at ₹ 1500, and using the most conservative estimates possible. With ₹ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in ""operational costs"" to ₹ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ₹ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.

Who in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea? Hell, Ahmadabad-Mumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours, and charge between ₹ 700-1400. The Shinkansen will be absolutely *flooded* if they drop prices.

###DO THE MATH","Debunked: ""Do the maths: India's first bullet train isn't 'free of cost' as Modi claims"" - lazy journalist"
697,Business/Finance,"Reposting from my earlier comment:

BloombergQuint explains it well here:

https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/2017/11/28/should-depositors-fear-the-new-financial-resolution-deposit-insurance-bill

ELI5 version: Say you are a bank and you have given out money to several entities. Say those entities are not able to return the money, so they become NPAs. What can a bank do in this situation?

* Do a bail out. 
* Do a bail in. 
* Go bankrupt and close down. 

The point of note here: These are the last steps that a bank  takes, there are several ways that the bank tries to recover money at first - selling the assets of the entity, selling the entity itself, issuing bonds to raise more money and avoiding bankruptcy, not issuing profits as dividends and absorbing them to solve NPAs, downsizing and firing staff etc. Infact, in the new bankruptcy laws which is already in place, the banks have the power to take over the entity and try to turn it around so that it becomes capable to pay off it's debts. Incase that's not possible, it can sell the entity itself and keep all the proceeds to itself, which is what's happening for some of the steel companies in India which form the largest NPAs. The promoters and owners of the said entity don't get any profits from the sale. 

With great bankruptcy laws, banks in developed nations are able to recover upto 60 % of NPAs. However, rates in India are low, only 20% of NPAs get recovered. 

Now imagine a hypothetical scenario where the bank has no other option but to use the last three options I discussed above. So what should it do?

With a bail out - the tax payers of the country give money to recover the bank. 

With a bail in - the depositors and customers absorb some losses and give money to recover the bank. 

Note: Whether a bail out or a bail in, it's the people who are going to pay for the recovery of the banks. Also note, every person who participates in an economy is a tax payer - whether of direct tax or indirect tax. 

Now comes the interesting part: RBI has insured all deposits in the banks to a sum of 1 lakhs. So if a bank goes bankrupt, you are insured a sum of upto 1 lakh and you can claim that amount from RBI. 

So what has changed in this law? Two things:

* The law has given the power to RBI to change the insured amount. This is necessary because when this 1 lakh insurance limit was set, it was in 1970s and it used to be a big amount then. 
* **Insured deposits do not come under bail in. ** Which is why the title that banks can wipe out your money is incorrect. 

What changes for you because of this law:

* Previously, without bail in option, if the bank was not bailed out, you could have claimed a maximum of 1 lakh from RBI as insured money. With bail in option, that remains the same, your insured amount of 1 lakhs is what you can claim if the bank goes bankrupt. 

* In extreme screnio, banks can take your deposits and bail in with that to save itself. However, if that point arrives, a bank going bankrupt is more disastrous than a bail in. 

Either way, people pay if bank get unrecoverable NPAs, either through taxes, or through deposits. Which is a better option is a point of debate. What's not a point of debate is that we need to strengthen our financial institutions, keep them away from political influence - one way is privitizing them, and get more robust bankruptcy laws application.  Because it is pointless fear mongering.

We had this discussion a few days ago. What do you think happens today if a Bank fails and the government does not choose to bail it out?

You lose all your money above 1 lakh and go sue the Bank.

The Bail In clause actually benefits you because you're going to be placed above bond interests because those Bonds will be used to recapitalize too, before coming after your deposits.

The matter of contention is that now the entity comes under scrutiny before actual failure, and that is a *good* thing. My bone with it is why do we need a separate corporation instead of empowering the RBI, but that's a different matter.

Seriously, what do you think the laws are today?

 So, if a bank has rising NPAs people will move accounts to a safer bank. Then the bank collapses on itself, from reducing accounts and rising NPAs? Because baa baa black sheep,have you any fools?


Yes sir,yes sir,one country full. This is extremely scary. Banks give huge loans to the wealthy and influential. They default and to cover the bank's losses, the depositers also take a 'hair cut'. For the money they forego, they are given equity in the bank which in most cases, will not be anywhere close to the extent of deposit used in 'bail in'. Same thing happened in Cyprus Bhaiyya bail out aur bail in nahi, gau out or gau in. Hamar dau dau bachiya hai. Kuch saal baad gau ban jaayi. Because There is no provision of cancellation of Deposits. 'Bail In' exempts Deposits and other liabilities while there is also provision of Insurance on every deposit account so your money remain safe. Bail In is the last resort to get you the money Depositors and Creditors apart from ₹100000 insurance money. As usual media is peddling fake news. Modi will leave us only after sucking us off every penny we have , kuch chutiya admi hain bhai  Earlier the insurance was 1 lakh, today its 0...  not all that different in the larger scale I feel ",1512448686.0,1,24,0,58,"Under the proposed Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2017, one idea is to have a bail in clause. 

The bill has suggested that the use of the 'bail-in' provision may result in *cancellation of a liability, which could extend to bank deposits,* or could lead to modification of the terms or changing the form of the asset class.

How is this even on the table?

http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/money-laundering/article17753382.ece [removed] What? You seriously think there is gonna be an investigation...lol. People are so naive.I pity them. Even Pakistan had more protest than here when Nawaz Sharif was named in Panama papers. Tells you how shitty the situation is if we have to look up to pak. Personally, I stopped giving a fuck about it long time back. This is because, I feel tax evasion is not that serious of a crime. I mean, yes they broke the law and everything but if you think about it, it doesn't compares with the likes of coalgate, fodder scam etc. They did not steal public money or anything. Chances are, many of us would have done the same thing like them to save taxes like they did. Hell, many of even do it now, on a smaller scale, by buying something something, and showing something else, so that we could a save a few buck in tax.
  
TL:DR; They didn't steal my money, so who cares. I don't. Source of this information? Work and jumla are different things. Govts after govts have lacked motivation on acting against corruption.  Modi ji ended all the corruption in the country. What papers are you talking about? Simply disclosure of names in the Panama leaks is neither an admission of nor a complicity in breaking the law.

Framing charges isn't the default first step in the judicial process. It is preceded by investigation, surveillance and intelligence. So calm your misplaced justice boner.

Moreover, RBI guidelines did not explicitly disallow overseas shell investment until ~2004ish. ",1491398686.0,1,77,0,256,"NO PROGRESS ON THE PANAMA PAPERS. OVER 1800 INDIAN NAMES HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED.

""The Panama Papers illuminate a key aspect of why the system isn’t working–because globalization has allowed the capital and assets of the 1 % (be they individuals or corporations) to travel freely, while those of the 99 % cannot.

Globalization is supposed to be about the free movement of people, goods, and capital. But in fact, the system is set up to enable that mobility mainly for the rich (or for large corporations).

The result is global tax evasion, the offshoring of labor, and an elite that flies 35,000 feet over the problems of nation states and the tax payers within them.""


PANAMA: No questions asked!

The ways of India’s rich and famous are increasingly becoming public knowledge. The disclosure that as many as five hundred prominent Indian’s, including Incredible India’s latest brand ambassador - Amitabh Bachchan, owned offshore companies in Panama is just the latest of the unraveling. All one can say is that he is in the good company of the likes of Vladimir Putin, David Cameron and Nawaz Sharif among others.

Panama is a small sliver of a country in Central America joining North and South America. Its immediate geographical neighbors are Costa Rica in the north and Colombia in the south. It is the narrow isthmus that separates the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. A 77 kilometers long manmade canal capable of accommodating large ships joins the two oceans. The revenues from this were for long the nations biggest source of income since the canal opened in 1914.

Panama soon found that becoming a tax haven that assured investors of their privacy provided a more lucrative income. The proximity to the Americas, and the balmy Caribbean islands, and countries like Colombia with its huge cocaine production and export business, and Latin America’s many kleptomaniac tin pot dictators made Panama even more attractive. Till not long ago the Canal Zone was under the protection of US troops and that too served as an incentive for Americans seeking an offshore tax haven.

Panama is a tax haven, which means it is a country that offers foreign individuals and businesses little or no tax liability in a fairly politically and economically stable environment. Tax havens also provide little or no financial information to foreign tax authorities. This in short is the reason Panama is so important to our moneyed people who have good reason to hide their real wealth.

Why do the rich then want to hide their wealth? This is simply because officially they are not as wealthy as they really are. And if they honestly declared their true wealth they would not only be liable to pay more income tax but could also open many of them to various charges of corporate fraud and malfeasances that could earn them hefty prison terms.
To comprehend this one must understand how most of our “captains of industry” many of whom sit on the Prime Ministers Council of Trade and Industry became rich and powerful?

When an “industrialist” launches a new project, the project costs are usually hugely overstated. The suppliers of plant and machinery then pay the promoter kickbacks, which become the promoter capital. Thus, the more the number of projects an individual promotes the wealthier he or she becomes. But it is not income you can declare. So it gets hidden in a tax haven. This is how the big bucks are made and salted away.

A good part of this money is round tripped back to India via nearby tax havens like Mauritius or Singapore. Not surprisingly in 2015 the top FDI investing countries were Mauritius (27%) and Singapore (21%). Both are now the home of hundreds of corporate entities that act as a pass through for funds being held overseas for Indians or Indian entities. These countries are little more than cutouts for monies held in other more distant tax havens like Panama, Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Lichtenstein. The smaller the country the more pliable the officials.

The fourteen PSU banks control almost 80% of the commercial credit advanced in India. In addition the government also owns the two big project finance institutions, IDBI and IFCI, and large institutional investors like LIC and general insurance companies like Oriental and GIC. The state ownership of these, with powers vested with the powers that be in New Delhi, political and bureaucratic, ensures that the projects are suitably “gold plated” without any rigorous scrutiny. And why scrutinize when projects seldom fold up and in a system where restructuring means lending more money to evergreen the loans?

The list of NPA’s includes almost the entire roster of top Indian companies. As of June 2016, the total amount of Gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) for public and private sector banks is around Rs. 6 lakh crore. The NPA figures along with total debt for each of the 49 public and private sector banks were shared by the Ministry of Finance in response to a Parliament question. According to RBI estimates, the top 30 loan defaulters currently account for one-third of the total gross NPA’s of PSU banks. Till March 31, 2015, the country’s top five PSU banks had outstandings of Rs 4.87 lakh crore to just 44 borrowers, if borrowers were to be categorized in terms of those having outstandings of over Rs 5,000 crore. These businesses include Essar, Reliance ADAG, Jaiprakash Associates, Adani's, GVK, GMR and Lanco. Some of them like Essar have defaulted in the before. This stress problem is fairly endemic.

Of the big companies or groups only Tata’s, Reliance Industries and AV Birla can be considered free of financial stress. Most if not all the money earned by gold plating plant and machinery, under invoicing of exports and over invoicing of imports is retained abroad. Has anyone wondered why the UAE is the second largest destination of India’s merchandise exports ($33 billion in 2015) and third largest source of merchandise imports ($26.2 billion in 2015)?

The UAE is also the largest source of legal and illicitly imported gold. Last year India officially imported over 900 tons of gold worth $35 billion. The mysteriously owned corporations incorporated in tax havens like Panama mostly finance these exports. And a good part of the illicitly exported gold also.

According to Global Financial Integrity, a Washington DC based think-tank; Indians were estimated to have illicitly sent out $83 billion in 2015. Where does this money go? Countries like Switzerland that offer banking secrecy usually do not pay any interest on such deposits. So money goes to corporations in tax havens from where they are invested in businesses world over. Have you ever wondered how many of our top businessmen have managed to become so big overseas so soon?
This is where the Panama’s of the world come in. 

There was a time when Panama in India was synonymous with a cheap brand of cigarettes manufactured by the Dalmia Golden Tobacco Company. In the West, Panama was a man's wide-brimmed straw hat made from the leaves of the Toquilla tropical palm tree. That Panama too is now forgotten. Now Panama is synonymous with offshore corporations and assured secrecy. The times have changed.

699,Business/Finance,"Honestly the job market wouldn't see you as a good candidate if you self educated yourself in something but have experience in something else. At least the big companies won't entertain your programming self studies or MOOCs if your past work experience of 8 years is not relevant. 

You could try putting every project, every course on github, making your skills as knowable as possible on blogs and/or YouTube. This would be my suggestion. Enter hackathons for programming, kaggle for AI, get your graphic designs up on display something like that. Anything noticeable. Programming like Java shouldn't be super tough to pick up initially. But of course the nuances are hard.

The thing is, the big companies trust other big companies to mould you similarly to how they want you. So if you're already moulded by another big company you're ready to start in theirs. If not... they don't really trust you and can't judge you well enough in interviews. It's risky for them.

Even though the exchanges & crypto community in India are seeking remedial action against RBI's diktat, I am not very hopeful that we'll be able to get a stay order from the Supreme Court of India in favour of crypto-currencies.

This decline in value is sure to repeat at the end of the 3 months window (keeping in mind the **assumption** that RBI's decision holds at the end of these 3 months) with a greater percentage fall this time because investors will not be able to convert their fiat to crypto anymore in India for the immediate future.

Chilling with people on the promenade along Rock Beach at 3 AM while both drunk and slightly stoned is one of the best experiences I've had.  Come visit us! Pondicherry is lovely this time of the Year!  Well planned roads, cheap booze, plenty of beaches, very close to Chennai, French grils ❤️ Moved out of Pondicherry a couple of years ago and this posts makes me miss home. Very peaceful to come visit. Especially right now. Go to the different beaches. Enjoy the architecture. Go to Auroville and smoke a blunt. Go to the Ashram and Matrimandir and get some peace. Take a bike and roam in the ""white town"" at 6 in the morning. And also, don't forget your alcohol.
Try out different restaurants in the evening and Nehru St and Mission St for all your shopping. If you are there on Sunday, do go to the Sunday Market on MG road. 

If you are driving, do fill up your tanks and also more in a storage. Cheapest rates IMO.

EDIT


Fun fact: When I mention white town, it is called the boulevard. The heart of Pondicherry. Was built by the French(duh). They have an amazing drainage system with two canals one going north-south and other east to west. The north South Canal also separates the white town from the regular town(The french were racists). The french lived in the white town next to the beach and the rest on the west. The french also constructed roads and all the east to west roads are parallel to each other and end at the beach. 
The regular town was also divided by the french based on religion. The north was full of Hindus and that is where you will find the old temples. The south was Christians. You will find beautiful churches and missionary schools. The South east was Muslims. Their roads are the unique roads in pondicherry where they don't end up in the beach but are diagonal and face the Mecca. There is a Pondicherry Arch at all the three borders when you enter Pondicherry. And also, two clock towers at the focii of the boulevard. Oh forgot to mention it is in the form of an [ellipse](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Puducherry/@11.9322492,79.8217652,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3a5361ab8e49cfcf:0xcc6bd326d2f0b04e!8m2!3d11.9138598!4d79.8144722). A lot of people in Chennai use Puducherry as a weekend getaway to binge but Puducherry has so much more to offer. There is some charm in taking a walk on those cobbled streets, going to Auroville  or Matrimandir.I have spent a lot of Sundays on those beaches reading a book. I used to finish entire novels there. In the evening, go to one of those restaurants and eat a sumptuous meal with a beer. Le Club was absolutely amazing.

Go to airbnb and book Thomas Kutty's (i think that was the name, or maybe I just made up a mallu sounding name trying to remember it..) homestay. Loved that place,hope it's still there. It's a small fisherman's house ON the beach converted into a homestay, with an open terrace that also has a kitchen. Visit the white town, go to the ashram if you're inclined to it, have some good dinner and cocktails at quaint hipsterish pubs and cafes, go to the proper town, buy cheap and great quality booze, carry other requisites (blunts, mosquito coil, camera to capture moon and sun rise and the occasional surfers and beach stunt boys in the morning). Eat some fresh fish. Live life. Do all this in any particular order. But most importantly,

DEFINITELY DRINK WAREHOUSE TEQUILA.  It's a local tequila you get there that is brutal.

Pondy has got something for all, cool scenes, ashrams and temples, commune living, cheap liquor, friendly people, great beaches, good shopping, great food, colonial and cultural places. And it's easy to access. Visited Puducherry in last Onam holidays. Hip place. 10/10.  Great place. Great beaches. Great booze. Well planned city. 

Also, if anyone visits, there is a place where the fishermen take you to the middle of the ocean and drop you in for and hour or so. Definitely try that. 

I heard there is scuba diving and such but haven't tried.  Baker Street and Cafe Xtasi FTW ! I really wish the architects and planners of the city had used some of the block planning from the French part of the city throughout the rest of the town as well. It's a great place but can be so much better. One more tidbit: 

Pondicherry has 9 medical colleges, 7 in Puducherry itself, probably the densest collection of medical colleges in all of India.

1. What is the best time to visit w/o burning your skin?
2. For someone vegetarian, non-smoker,teetotaller, what to do here? Le café , so many memories!  I live 10km from Pondicherry across the border in TN and thanks for the cheap petrol and drinks over the years. Visited Pondi few years back. Had an amazing time. Paradise beach, main beach, Aurbindo ashrams, beer brewery (from gate), Matrimandir all were fantastic. Couldn't get into beer brewery as we didn't know we could schedule our visit a day before.  
Loved it. :) Thanks for the memories.   
Po Pondy!!  [deleted] One of the cleanest place you could witness within tamilnadu will be obviously puducherry.... What language do the commoners speak? If a Northie Hindi/English speaker was to join JIPMER would he face any problem? On the border touching Pondy and Cuddalore, there is a bar called ""Kennedy"". The ambience was one of kind because most of the tables are in a coconut grove with the tables around the trees. And oh, they server Rat meat there or so the menu said. 

Anyway, great place. I was lucky as a friend of mine lived there.  Been here twice! I think this was the last vacation I've had! It's beautiful. The streets have such a comfy feel to it, man.

How? Do they hack Whatsapp or whatsapp willingly just hand over user data(which is bread and butter of FB) to any wannabe ?

For reference - https://www.eff.org/node/82654

 I work in a company which  has largest market share in banking software. These products assist banks to maintain security, DB, financial rules like BASEL and many other things.I work in RDBMS and big data maintenance along with cloud encryption. So, let me tell you a thing or two on how this system works.

First of all, simply by knowing your phone number using whatsapp will not be sufficient to hack a bank. It's like throwing a pebble on a lion at some kung-fu nerve and hoping to kill it. It's ridiculous so I will not even justify discussing this here because it's not quora and assume people over here to just use their logic a little. 

Now let us assume discussion is about hacking an individual's bank account, phishing is the most reliable way to do it. But be always aware to check if the website you have opened is https or not. It is a very basic thing. **NEVER OPEN LINKS USING YOUR MAIL ACCOUNT.** Phishing basically fools you to think that you are logging in to a bank but it is a private page of a hacker and you are basically texting him your password by typing over there. Now any hacker can easily deceive google security by making a hash code which he can crack easily so you wouldn't be notified by google too that this page is a security risk. Then there are other ways too. OTPs come on your phone and in more than a few cases, locked phones prompts the message on screen and OTP can be seen from that screen. This wouldn't be hacking but more like theft. **This btw is the best and to my knowledge the only way to hack into your friend's facebook account**. There are other ways too but phishing is the most common. It is like a king's pawn opening with many varities of its own. Usually a hacker develops his own way to phish but in 99% of the cases that involves sending you a mail and you opening a link through it or using your intranet or VPN to deceive the router.

>Indian banking system under attack!

This headline though is not about individual attacks on users but about an attack on a bank itself i.e. injecting your malware in their servers to redirect you to phishing or anywhere from bank's servers directly. It is very much possible for high end hackers but they will be caught by the system easily. One of my company's software provide three layers of security after authentication which is almost impossible to break. Other products provide microservices to enhance security over different modules. Banks hire other firms solely to enhance security and have their own departments to enhance it even more. Banks have multiple servers and their multiple back ups in multiple locations through which data traverse while your authentication happens. So physically hacking a server may get you past first layer but not other layers. Now using cyber attacks to go past all the servers is very very very tough. It's like landing on moon tough. ~~Countries who have that capability can do that~~ Then again, their are people with advanced brains and skills who dream of owning an island so theoretically they also might do it.  But a malware which redirects you to a different webpage through a bank's server is also possible but would be detected in milliseconds. Such a malware can remain in system to attack for that 1 millisecond for a few times but then again transactions are extremely hard to do even after knowing your passwords because banks detects IP jumps, have OTP verification process, have card grids any many other ways to ensure transaction is done by you and not by someone else.

TL;DR  : Even if someone puts a malware in a bank which is **extremely tough** and that easily detectable, he might get an idea of your bank balance but he can't do transactions. These are mostly rumors to shake stock markets by targeting those non-technical, superstitious and no chicken on Tuesday stock dealers.

Knowledge nugget: Start using Kali linux if you feel like hacking into your friend's computers and using their webcams and microphones. Start with creating word document with a listener and mailing it to your friend and ensuring that he opens the attachment. You will start making your own ways once you get addicted to it. Edit: OP has made some effort to actually try and substantiate his position, while several other comment threads are on random threats you can face online.

Firstly to OP, good on you for focus. 

As to why this doesnt count as proof - 

Articles 1 and 2, both link to articles on the same phishing attacks being targeted at ICICI users 

Article 3, talks about 

> India's third-largest private-sector bank Axis Bank   has appointed auditing firm EY to probe a cyber attack that came to its notice last month, a report in the Economic Times  says.

> The ET report said Axis was contacted by an engineer from Moscow-based Kaspersky anti-virus firm who told the bank that he had discovered a bug in Axis' systems while carrying out a separate probe. The bank has filed a report with the Reserve Bank of India appraising it of the situation. 

Firstly, if you are bringing E&Y to check your code... well, now you have 2 problems. (3, KASPERSKY has gotten in touch with you, and someone decides to go with E&Y? Wtf?)

There is something more material in that article here: 
>In June this year, the Reserve Bank of India had formulated a comprehensive policy that it wants banks to roll out. The guidelines outline an indicative set of baseline cyber security and resilience requirements,  steps to set up a ""cyber security operation centre"" and a template for reporting incidents to the central bank

But again, this is not proof that there is an Attack on the Indian banking system. Suggestive, but also business as normal for people to create and implement policy and security improvements.

Article 4 - 
> Public sector Union Bank of India on Friday said one of the bank’s offshore accounts was breached in a cyber attack but the money trail was traced and movement of funds was blocked.

Again, the fact that banks are targeted is not new. If there were multiple attempts to physically rob banks we would say theres a *spree* of bank robberies. Not that there is an attack on the banking system. You would have to prove that all these attacks are linked and designed to damage/bring down the Indian banking system.


Finally - theres 2 articles on security breaches. Sadly they happen. But again, bad net sec does not an attack make.


Again, extraordinary claims, extraordinary proof. You have to show that there is a sustained, organized and directed attack on the Indian Banking system. Not that Indian banks have still to improve their security.

 
------------
Wth?

Dude, proof or gtfo. For this to be an issue you would need to have a fraudulent transaction rate Increase across all banks.

This is something checked on a daily basis and if there was a rise or a spike, it would be an issue discussed or raised elsewhere.

You are making an implicit accusation and an explicit one.

1) Indian banking system is under attack

2) since it is being attacked and no one is aware about it, people checking errors and fraud are either zombies or sweeping it under the rug or are not bringing it to the authorities 

Either claim is extraordinary and for extraordinary claims there needs to be extraordinary proof.

Provide the proof.

  Seems like a forwarded WhatsApp spam message.
 Awareness about skimmers, Phishing, Vishing is the key. End user is too naive to understand this. As a security professional I took it as my personal responsibility to make my friends & family members aware about secure practices while using cards offline or online, while using social media & while browsing internet & about how to identify & avoid suspicious emails. Chip + PIN is not entirely safe. I posted here few weeks back about an incident where ₹ 20k were withdrawn from my account using a debit card at an ATM in a different city whereas the card was with me all the time. Luckily the bank (HDFC) credited the amount back in around 3 weeks, which is great but not sure if every other bank does it. To add when this happened, a bank official told me this has been happening with many people of late so I think some fuck up has happened with our banking system. Only option is to use cash now or keep your account balance low till it gets better, which I don't know how or when is gonna get.  Its actually not that hard to prevent you from reading smses from banks. You dont even need to fake an ID to do that

You can get an sms bomber for as cheap as 5 dollars and Call bomber for 10 dollars.

Point being, If a fraudster already has your bank details there is very little you can do to protect yourself. So get yourself the chip + pin cards like op says to better protect yourself. Source? As a security engineer I would like to spend extra million dollars to put few cisco NAC appliances next to firewall. Also will be strict allowing thumb drives on any bank peripherals. 

I wil put all windows xp machines behind secondary  firewall, they are very easy to hack in to while upgrading any windows servers that are still windiws 2000.

 ⁠⁠⁠I worked at EY briefly in their computer security division in the US some 14-15 years ago - they existed mainly to give a clean chit to the customer. They would bill heavily (my rate was like $600 an hour), make a big dog and pony show of conducting an audit, officially report only the most obvious mistakes, and work with the customer to ensure their public image was well managed. 

I quit working there mainly because of the huge gap between my ethical expectations and theirs.

The same EY is now auditing Axis. Kek. Dude listen, many of us here are tenured cyber security professionals from various industries. This happens all the time. The links that you have shared are aping each other because some company that sells some product or services related to the security domain has decided to make noise about these happenings and fix up a few presales calls with the bankers. 
The articles don't talk about how often these things happen or how many findings and incidents are under remediation as we type..


We saw a similar global buzz of articles when Fireeye used the Target breach for publicity a few years ago...
You still see them appear now and then in the media trying to make noise about breaches by APTs of state actors and China in particular. 


This wave is local to India. All I can say is Indian banking industry stays compliant to RBIs guidelines for information security as a guidance. They are loosely based on ISO 27k. There are frequent notifications from RBI related to new risks and threats that should be acted upon. 


There are industry specific threats and malware and the controls in place usually keep any major incidents from occurring. IT risk forms an important part of the Basel 3 standard too and measuring and managing the risks is a well oiled component. The risk exposure of a bank decides the capital needed as collateral to be kept with the RBI to offset any issues. None of these breaches are big enough to cause a major impact on the health of these banks.


We have a new Governor at the RBI signing notes. At the most, this collation of incidents into a bouquet could be an attempt to spook him into issuing a notification could benefit a certain group of vendors... don't read too much into it.
 It happens all the time. Everywhere. Banks are common targets. 

Unless you know and can tell us something groundbreaking, this sounds like WhatsApp forward I fear the botnet so I always register at places with a number different from the one registered with the bank. Is this a concerted attack over the last few days and do we have reason to believe that *Neighborly State Actors* could be directing this ? Lol, its so easy to hack a bank. Tons of branches especially of SBI, Canara are still using Windows XP machines, un-updated, un-patched and probably using a pirated version. You could load up a malware in pendrive, do some stupid social engineering to get them to insert your pendrive and you're done. Ohh, and I think they're still using IE6 or something. My Citibank credit card was skimmed and 48000 INR was withdrawn and that's the max limit for cash withdrawal. Fortunately I am in a different country with the card in hand with me and skimmed card was used in India. I was able to provide all the proof that I am out of country and prove that I have the card and Citibank might credit the amount back.

It was Chip and Pin card and yet it's not secure. Nothing is fraud proof. 

Some tips :
Never be lazy shout out the pin number at fuel or hotel places. It takes a minute to walk out of the car or your seat to insert the card yourself and enter the pin. 

Put a tape on the number and better to memorize Not trying to call this a clickbait or anything, but there is no need to push that red panic button either. One thing to remember is that if you take care of basic things like not sharing your passwords or any personal info with anyone, no harm can usually befall upon you.

And sorry, I don't think that the people guarding our financial systems are clueless. Had that been the case, there would have been panic everywhere - you and me would not be doing e-commerce transactions on flipkart in a relaxed manner, and people would still be carrying nothing but cash and gold bullion on them.

Such untoward incidents do happen sometimes, but there are so many checks and balances in the economy that the person doing such frauds are easily caught within days, it doesn't pay to do this for long term. >> moving away from WhatsApp is a sensible decision (use BBM/ Threema) so that your identity details through phone numbers is not compromised.

Can you explain? I was at a ATM yesterday and this guy came to me and asked if I have credit card, although I don't I told him I do just to make him go away. Then he asked me my name and phone number. I gave him my phone number. Can I be in trouble?  http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-banks-on-guard-after-data-security-breach-at-private-lender-1476576 The ideal solution would be to withdraw all of the amount or transfer it to a non-indian bank, right?

 Talk about sensationalism and click bait titles.  ",1476869670.0,1,84,0,170,"I have a strong reason to believe that Indian banking is under systematic attack. The shit hole goes very deep and the problem is compounded by the fact that the media ""tones"" down its coverage (obviously to avoid panic). There are malware attacks (on ICICI which is siphoning of email contacts and sending its account holders phishing emails), Advanced persistent threats on Axis Bank (they disclosed this to RBI), ATM frauds as in State Bank of India and multiple accounts of phishing attacks on individuals. Union Bank has also suffered cyber heist. 

A worrying trend is by use of SIM Swap. Fraudsters get your personal details (easily available through WhatsApp), your details through identity thefts and blocking your actual SIM's so that you cannot receive the SMS alerts. 

Two factor authentication is very basic (dependent on passwords alone) which again can be easily retrieved because most users re-use their passwords. 

Its getting scarier and worsened. 


A simple remedy as of now is to change PIN of your existing debit card and get ""CHIP and PIN"" card which secures transaction because they cannot be replicated easily. Of course, moving away from WhatsApp is a sensible decision (use BBM/ Threema) so that your identity details through phone numbers is not compromised. 

Edit 1: In response to ""proofs"" and so called ""click bait""; here are the links. Please connect the dots. 
Further, BBM and Threema allow you to be anonymous because outside the system, they can't do anything to your PINS. :-)

706,Business/Finance,"Stay in nederdraad. Visit once twice a year. You won't regret long term.  It's at such times only that you have to decide your priorities in life, and develop and follow your principles. I personally believe in this - ""The quality of your life is the quality of your relationships"". A poor person can be quite happy if surrounded by people he loves. A very rich man will not be happy without loved ones.

That said, things are more complicated. Employment and infrastructure is bad in India. And it's not always that our family or relationships will be good. So you have to decide whether things are worth it.

One idea probably is to work in your prime years abroad, earn a shitload of money, marry a desi import or someone okay with moving to India, save your money, and return to India in time for your kids to go to college. And retire here. All the while visiting as much as you can, to keep in touch with family and also making arrangements for your future.

Or another one is to take the leap of faith, return to your motherland, try and work to do your bit to improve this country, and save your wife and kids the trauma of moving.

Staying there, you will always remain an outsider. And so will your kids, be them desi or mixed race. I wouldn't want that for my children. Family sticks when no one will. Your 'friends' and 'neighbours' won't take care of you when you're​ sick or grow old. I am in no way expert, but try to earn as much as possible there and then move back as the other guy said. Buy everything you need here while working there (car, house, maybe savings for marriage and kids) and then find a job here before moving back. It will be rough but smoothen it out with money.

Is there any possibility that your parents can fly over to Netherlands for maybe 2-3 months in-between for just traveling and will ease the homesickness while allowing them to also enjoy?

 Stay. With family it's ""door ki cheez sona, pass ki cheez chapal."" , your value diminishes as long as you be with your family. Catch 22.
Based on my experience, I still have not found any answer to this question.
But stay in ND till you find a way out. Seems your mind says Netherlands, but your heart says India. FWIW, the software industry in India has improved over the last few years. There is considerable foreign investment in the market right now and if you display your skills well, you can make comparable money. Also, years of interacting with the west and many NRIs coming back has resulted in some of that culture rubbing off. If you know where to look for, you will find places that value employee well being as a means to overall productivity. Keep away from the big four obviously. I think you should stay there. 
&nbsp;

You have mentioned that you can fly your mother there but there is no one to look after you siblings? But you also mentioned that your sibling(s) are about to graduate? I think they can manage staying alone for a couple of weeks. 
&nbsp;

Talk to them about it. And later, they can accompany your mum too! I'm not sure if I'm the right guy for this, but you should ask yourself instead of strangers. 100 people will give 100 different answers. Ultimately you are responsible for your own life. Don't leave NL or stay there just because 90% of the subreddit says so. Its your life and you alone should make the choice. Nobody here has any idea of your thoughts, beliefs, values etc. Personally I would quit my comforts to live with my family regardless of them giving me any bhaw or not. Its because I love them. I would do that. But that doesn't mean you should too. Flip a coin, while its in the air, the result you hope for is the correct choice. As for a personal opinion, money and good lifestyle can only get you so far. The ultimate thing is being happy inside. And if being with your family makes you happy, then by all means return to your country. It doesn't matter if you've got a villa, a swimming pool and a fuckload of money with 2 yr leave,if you're lonely. If you want to be with your family and it seems like you do take them there or move back home. Its all upto you. Good luck brother. Please do update someday what you did.  Come back to live with your family and make India progress with your incredible talent.  Could you not try and set up your own business from the Netherlands and when this runs well enough move it to India? Software engineering can be done anywhere? 
I am from the Netherlands, I adopted my daughter from India. Since politician Wilders is spouting his hatred she also has a harder time. I am not sure where this will end. Sometimes I fear that Muslims will be the new Jews in another 10 years or so. (My daughters biological parents were most likely Hindu, by the way) Visit often or get your family to Netherlands Stay there...build a good social circle and build a good life. Over time, try and move your family there.  IMO you should Come back only if you have a good plan. Regarding occupation, I've heard some of the start-up's here giving at-least some of the benefits you have mentioned, certainly not the two year sick leave but, your experience will be valued for sure. This post is a reason why I always vote for accepting bullying in adult social situation. You need a kick in the ass for a reality check, being pampered too much these days I see. Stop this drama, grow a pair and get ahead. You know everything you need to, stop trying to seek validation.  > When I am in the Netherlands I have to do everything by myself. But when I am in my own country then my mom takes care of the cooking. We have a maid for cleaning. My brother takes care of all of the groceries. I can go out and buy my country's snacks, street food everyday. I can eat my own food everyday.

from your post I think you need a wife. I'm sure you can get a maid to do cleaning, and order groceries online; where as your wife will cook you your own food.

you need to asses your situation yourself. why are you asking yourself this question. Is it for your comfort or to keep your mother/siblings happy. I see that you've mentioned that you are responsible for running your family. In that case, you could run your family from anywhere in the world as long as you are sure that there is someone you could trust locally that can act as you proxy, which in this case your brother.

your dilemma is that you want to go home, but you don't want to leave this lavish lifestyle you've become accustomed to. Also as an added bonus staying would give you more money for yourself and to run your family.

the real question is would be able to stay away from your family and see them for short intervals in a year. if yes, then stay. If you feel like you're missing the love of your family, and cannot bear the solitude then go back home. Are you the last of a dying breed?  Stay in Netherlands and get epic rich. Visit home atleast twice a year. This may happen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0dk9vx2yks Bhai, the answer is simple. Ask yourself, love berween your family members is more important or money? Your mother will add fewer  years than you, your sister will go to someone else after a few years and the MONEY, you can burn it in Netherlands if you are feeling cold. 

Sure we are a developing country and we have a hell lot of problems, but I cannot even think of ditching my parents to get 'comfortable' in a developed country. My parents struggled financially, emotionally to raise me, I can't turn my back on them. Whatever happens to them, I will stay with them. Money, that comes later. Love and happiness of my family members collectively is paramount. Get new family in Netherlands. Maybe 2 more families somewhere on the side.j/k

 Stay in Netherlands, continue to do your job. In your extra time research and try to start your business (DON'T QUIT YOUR JOB). 

If your business lifts off :

1. You'll have much more money for your family (think sister's marriage/ brother's education).
2. You can move your family there and settle down.
3. You can quit your job and run that business from India while earning money (and spending less).

If your business doesn't lift off :

1. This will help you find faults in your approach, so that you can refine your business model.
2. Keep working at your job, build more experience. Then apply to a bigger company for more salary.

Best of luck with life and such! Visit some night spots in Amsterdam.. have some magic cakes .. feel good .. enjoy the moment..  You asked in the wrong place, mate.

People on this subreddit are so desperate to escape India for some reason, they will immediately tell you to stay in Europe. WTF?This is such a stupid doubt to have .

On March 16, Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016 was passed as a money bill. During the debate, our finance minister said time and again that the Aadhaar cards will be used specifically for providing subsidies and other financial benefits. He *said* it, but if anyone had bothered to take a peek into the proposed bill, they would have understood what was going on. 

But alas, the bill was brought on a Friday, our representatives had to fly back home. It's [""Take out the Trash"" day](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4l3qup/how_pleb_mps_try_to_impose_their_will_and_fail/)! So, meh.

*For a detailed analysis of what the Aadhaar Bill contains and why it was passed a s money bill, [read this](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking)*

**Changing the bill *after* it becomes an Act**

Aye. That can be done. 

There is a whole **Clause 54** left lying around titled ""Power of Authority to make Regulations"" in the [passed Aadhaar Act, 2016](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2016/168717.pdf). This particular clause lets the government change multiple aspects of the bill by issuing notifications. These notifications are then supposed to be laid formally in both houses of Parliament once the next session begins.

[Clause 54: Regulations rock peepal!](http://imgur.com/A5DXwmx)

[MOAR REGULATIONS!](http://imgur.com/q5hLCrm)


Look at these particular subsections. The government can change provisions for any of these *without the prior approval of Parliament*:

- [Biometric Information](http://imgur.com/i4lD5oS)

- [Other purposes](http://imgur.com/wqW7aPQ)

- [Other tech safeguards](http://imgur.com/xrJZpCO)

- [Maintaining, updating and deletion of Aadhaar numbers](http://imgur.com/3xhjdhm)

All of these subsections are so bloody vague that they can cover anything that a citizen does. What the heck does ""other purposes"" even mean?!

I have never seen anyone in Parliament challenging a notification. Many Acts are slyly changed in this manner. Please note (before you start outraging about how evil the present government is), this phenomenon is not something that was started by the Modi government, all governments in the past have been doing it in one way or the other. By keeping the wordings vague in the proposed bill itself, it gives a leeway for the executive to change it at a later date without consulting Parliament.

But... this has to stop somewhere, right? RIGHT?

#What can we do about it now?

Well, nothing, I’m afraid. I just wanted to put it out there. The only public intervention possible was *before* the Bill became an Act.  

Unless the [Supreme Court strikes down the Aadhaar Act’s validity](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4g34n7/an_important_supreme_court_hearing_is_coming_up/) or says it’s an invasion of the fundamental right to privacy, the public can’t do anything about it except watch & get Aadhaar cards in the process. 

If the SC *does* strike the Act down, I’m afraid it might be too late. The government is already on an overdrive to get maximum Aadhaar registrations. They are claiming that more than a billion people are now registered, even Aanganwaadis and Government hospitals are doing daily drives to get newborns registered.


I will end with a quote by a wise fictional one eyed man called Alastor “Mad Eye” Moody:

707,Business/Finance,"There is absolutely no substitute for hard work. Whether or not you go to college. 
If you are clueless about what to do , find something that will make you enough money to have a stable life. 
It's okay not to be passionate about what you do. Don't fall for stories or non conformists, as this is a small percentage of people who find success in what they do, which does not involve working for a corporate.

Be passionate about hardwork. 
 I am an entrepreneur and let me tell you something about entrepreneurship and life. 

DO NOT start your own business unless you have a product to sell and know what you are doing. And do not start a business without having a back up plan and back up money. You will burn money like anything without even realising. Most entrepreneurs fail. Big time. But you don't hear about it because failure never sells. 

Trust me when i say this, i am not discouraging you. Just telling you to be prepared for failure because this road is tough. Behind every success story is a path that was riddled with failure. 

You are just 22. List down your immediate, medium term and long term goals and stick it somewhere where you can see/check everyday. If your ultimate goal is to become an entrepreneur one day, i highly recommend you get a job in an industry where you see yourself doing the same thing and getting some experience learning the inside and outside of it. 

Apart from this, i highly suggest that, whatever money you earn from henceforth, put aside 30-40% of it into savings. Mutual Funds, Fixed Deposits, etc. This will help you in the future.  ",1492323781.0,1,47,0,32,"I am in a very big dilemma right now. I have to choose between staying in my current job in Netherlands and become a wealthy man or going back to my own country and stay with my family(and not be so wealthy).

Background:

A bit of a background, I come from a south asian (pakistan,india,bangladesh) country where I lived with my family. I live with my mom, brother and little sister. I am 28 years old and not married. I am responsible for the finances of my house. So i pay for everything, including the college fee of my brother and sister and daily expenses such as food, electricity, rent etc. The college fee is done now as they are both in their last semester. Although, I will still be responsible for our daily expenses.

I recently went to the Netherlands and studied there for two years. I got a degree and even found a really nice job.

I have two options to choose from:

**Option 1: Stay at my current Job in Netherlands**

I have a really nice job in the Netherlands. There is such a big difference in the working conditions that I don't think I can work as a software engineer when I come back home.

My one month's salary in Netherlands is equal to my 3-4 months salary in my own country. In fact the difference in salary is so big that I dont think I can work as a software engineer when I go back home. It will just feel wrong to me to do the same type of work for 1/4th of the money.

Almost all companies treat you like a human in the Netherlands. They have really nice laws about employment law. I don't have to work overtime and even if I do work overtime, I will be paid for the overtime. This is not the case in my own country. In my country they expect you to work overtime and think you are not motivated if you refuse. And they will never pay you for overtime.

In the Netherlands you can be on sick leave for a maximum of two years and still get paid salary. Though it is not so common to be sick for so long but it is really comforting to know. In my country they start deducting your holidays when you are sick. And when all of your holidays are gone then they start deducting your salary. And if you dont show up after two months then there is a big chance you will be let go.

Besides my job, I have other benefits in the Netherlands. I have been on so many dates in the Netherlands which was not so easy in my country. Online dating is still non-existent in my country. I currently have a girlfriend in the Netherlands. I feel really free and independent in terms of dating. I can go to anyone's house and invite any girl in my own house I also have nice public transport, online shopping for almost all video games, books, clothes etc. I have a really nice gym. The only career i can think of having when I go back is do my own business.

While living in Netherlands has good points, there are also some bad things. There are some things that make me hate Netherlands sometimes. If I stay there for one year without a holiday then I get really miserable. I really miss my family on my holidays. I also feel that they sometimes look at us in a condescending way.I have had a lot of incidents related to racism. It seems like they feel like they are much better than us. I have been asked all sorts of questions like : Is there a tv in your country? Do you have internet in your country? Do you know what a washing machine is ? Sometimes people give me a look of disgust even. And they get more weird if they know I am a muslim. 
 
**Option 2: Go back to my home country and live with my family**

I mentioned a lot of really nice things in the first option but I really miss my family and my country's food. My mom is always very sad when my holidays are up and I have to go back. She is always crying when I leave. She said that I can stay in the Netherlands for as long as I want but she is happy when I am around. My little sister also misses me. She told me that I should come back next year. She is going to be married in a few years then I wont be able to see her so often. When I am in the Netherlands I have to do everything by myself. But when I am in my own country then my mom takes care of the cooking. We have a maid for cleaning. My brother takes care of all of the groceries. I can go out and buy my country's snacks, street food everyday. I can eat my own food everyday.

Regarding finances, i will have around 20k$ of savings by next year. What is your opinion?",Stay in an excellent job vs come back to live with my family?
708,Business/Finance,"You do know that Bitcoin cannot be regulated and a ban would only hamper the perceived sovereignty of INR.  No problem with bitcoin gaining popularity, but the reading the replies of OP here, it seems he created this post to shove his point of view up others asses rather than to listen to their point of views. Ok, I'll bite.

Sure they have. But is it illegal in India or USA ? If tomorrow Amazon decides that it will accept payments in Gold , Bitcoins or any legal doohickeys , can they prosecute Amazon ? This is NOT a rhetorical question so please feel free to answer.


Plus why would I buy anything using a bitcoin today if as you say yourself "" ...will make you rich over time if you just put a $100 in there today"" ? 

Some people were not fortunate as you are today. They knew that in a year their Tulip could have fetched more than an entire country , but unfortunately they could not preserve it. We don't have that problems with BTC. So lets never use them till each BTC is worth a gazillion kabillion dollars.

> Currency wallets (payment banks) are outdated by atleast 5 years, they were big in 2010 in the USA and today nobody uses them

I suppose Paypal , and the newly introduced Google Wallets , Amazon pay , Samsung Pay, Apple Pay , Isis wallet are just barely hanging in there with NOBODY using them. Starbucks processing more than 8 million transactions each week on its own wallet is just an alternate fact , ain't it !

I wonder if there were people ready to throw money at the hackers but could not understand the ABC of a BTC !


Another Offtopic : I read a book (or watched a documentary, can't remember) wherein some biologists and psychiatrists mentioned that the bubbles actually cause lunacy like symptoms. They did some fun studies to illustrate this and they took like brain scans as well. It was stupid enough that I dismissed it, but if anyone knows what I am talking about , please link me that book. call me old-school, I don't believe in bitcoins, investing in it is just nothing more than gambling. if few key players who owns the majority chunk of bitcoins will cash it out, it would never regain it's current market value, and that's just one possibility how it can go down, there are bazillion other possibilities that can cause the crash, meanwhile there is absolutely no assurance by any key economist, IMF, world bank that it's have any reliability and reason to stay. 

also there is a big myth that it bitcoins can be transferred instantaneously, in reality conformation of transaction take hours.

quite recently economist have published a very sensible article [""*What if bitcoin bubble bursts?*""](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21722841-latest-frenzy-tulip-mania-gold-rush-or-dotcom-boom-what-if-bitcoin-bubble), I suggest everyone to give it a read, and please do think thrice before 'investing' in bitcoins.

709,Business/Finance,"But when Americans spend money in America, the money stays in America. But if you will spend money in India, most of this money will go out of India.
Example: Buy a IPhone product in America and India.  I get a feel this is snake oil logic. 

People need money to spend. Here currency is inr, so exporters would get paid in inr, and hence the Q may be to ask why is dollar so much more valuable and also why do Americans have so much more of it ? 

I have personally thought over what creates value at the very core and the answer always seems to me to be creation of new intellectual property in which US is the leader and will be for more time to come. 

As to why Americans have so much of it? I think it might be a very complicated Q and part of answer might be that they print it and also that lot of countries want to save in dollars and also invest in infrastructure creation in America... 
 This is not true on so many levels - the most obvious being that the spending habits of a nations's people has a very weak relationship (and even an inverse relationship sometimes) with the national debt. This is literally why macroeconomic indicators and microeconomic indicators should not be lumped or confused. Japan as a country is one of the most indebted nations with a debt to GDP ratio of 240%, while US is at about 106%. But it is just an indicator. If a government is borrowing mostly from its citizens in the form of government bonds (like the US) its not a big deal. If a government is borrowing to finance projects which will lead to economic growth, it can pay off those debts and have surplus left over in the future so its not a problem. For example, Greece's peak debt to GDP ratio of 160% was a huge concern because the economy was not growing, while the Japanese economy has strong fundamentals so they can keep borrowing.

Also if you look at it from the other side, China basically needs new jobs every year to feed its people. It is an export driven economy that pays for these jobs by selling the massive amount US dollars it gets from these exports for RMB (Yuan) that it then gives to its people. But this increases the supply for US dollars which left unchecked would overvalue the RMB and China would then lose its competitive edge in the manufacturing market. So to always keep the Yuan slightly undervalued it buys enough long-term US government bonds. These bonds also act as low risk investments that keep its portfolio diversified against the high risk manufacturing projects that it takes on in Africa for example.

So platitudes like 'Saving is sin, and spending is virtue' might sound reasonable and be applicable at a microeconomic level, but does not work at all when you are talking about countries. 'Keep your investment portfolio diversified' is a better saying that applies to virtually all levels of consumers. Hmm I don't know why people in the thread are thinking this is some mind blowing non mainstream line of thought.

OP can be easily explained as a version of Keynesian economics and demand side economics. Put money in the pockets of workers and the economy will grow because they spend more than they save. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-demandside-economics.asp Looks like another attempt at emotional blackmailing Indians to give up their gold and other savings for a better “future”  The reason why everyone ""invests"" in Dollars is because that is the currency for oil trade.

Unless you have a specific agreement like India and Iran, the default currency to buy crude oil is USD.

So everytime, every country wants to buy oil, it has to buy USD from the market and then pay the oil supplier. This keeps the USD strong compared to other currencies.

Also, the reason Americans consume so much is because they don't have strict import laws to ""protect"" the local industries like we do. The buyers in the US are free to choose what quality of products they want to use. And usually it's an imported products that is priced better than a local brand.

If we (India) remove import duty, we fear that Tata and Mahindra will die out. While the US takes it as a challenge and makes newer Chevys and Fords and, ahem, Chryslers.

No mean feat. 

Australia and Japan have completely legalized BTC and it is being used as tender for everything from grocery to cars, South Korea as well, even Malaysia's btc market is booming. 

Meanwhile Indian Gov is actively trying to play down BTC, some ministers are still calling it scam, play of the devil, likening it with ""chit funds"" etc. What the fuck is wrong with the finance brains and the IT brains of our country that we (as a country) are missing out on the biggest IT development since world wide web thanks to illiterates talking their talk. 

And Im not talking about middle men like ""Zebpay"" and ""Unocoin"" - Bitcoin was invented to cut these middlemen out of the chain, yet these are the ones who are profiting selling BTC to Indians at a 25% markup price and taking a hefty commission. 

We are also giving a big play to more middle men companies like PayTM who are trying to reinvent the currency wheel and are doing such a bad job at it, yet most Indians will tell you that PAYTM is the best and Bitcoin is a scam. Currency wallets (payment banks) are outdated by atleast 5 years, they were big in 2010 in the USA and today nobody uses them - yet PAYTM is such a big rage here - outdated technology, very poor profitablity, the PAYTM business exists only to support its CEO and turn him into a Billionaire while the rest of the PAYTM user base suffers from lack of basic communication access with Paytm.


Make no mistake, India will follow the rest of the world eventually, as we always do, and end up accepting BTC in 2020, but by that time the world would have already moved on and derived the most out of bitcoin. Many businesses are already hedging their funds vs BTC or investing part of their profits into BTC and the growth of 2500% since 2015 will only make more companies turn to BTC.

710,Business/Finance,"I don't like where this is going. A biometric way of identification should be implemented to protect one's identity, not be given to MNCs who can invent ways to isolate people based on their unique identification. 

Why are bills and laws being passed with vague terminology and wording? The largest democracy in the world is proving to be the most retarded democracy in protecting its own people and their interests. 

Even after such loopholes are discovered and exposed, the Supreme Court is just sitting on its ass and not doing anything to correct the flawed system. If such an attitude is displayed by the highest authority of the country, why do we even respect the institution named ""Supreme Court""??!! To be more precise, what respect does the Supreme Court exhibit towards the common man??? I used to be one of the ""meh, why such a ruckus about Aadhar's biometrics"", but I must say, this shit is truly scary now. Orwellian seems to be the word.

Stuff like Iris enabled tabs are still in their early stages and cost might be a factor, but a decade from now, a govt could do whatever it wants with this.

Also that rule about FIR's is fucking silly. Assume I get mugged, how in fuck am I supposed to remember my Aadhar card number? Retarded shit. Do we have Right to Privacy though? 

Article 21 says : No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.

Any lawyers who can clear up please? Most people here have not deciphered the government's game plan on Aadhar. Basically, it wants to side step and push until one can get it via underhanded tactics. So, technically it might not be required but they will push it as they know courts have a high turn around time. By then, they would have achieved their REAL objective - mass collection of  data.
 [deleted] awesome writeup. govt is trying their best to shove aadhar down our throats. looks like soon i'm going to be deprived of basic amenities because i lack Aadhar card (proliferation in Bengal is not much still) I did not want to make aadhar account. But then I was forced to because my new employer, an US based MNC, made it mandatory.

Is it legal for foreign based companies to ask for you aadhar card? I am not able to wrap my head around this issue, so guys help me here please. 

**Identification** - OP and others have given examples of Aadhaar being required for authentication and identification in various scenarios. Things like, FIR, Attendance, Skype calls with Govt, deliverance of government services and subsidies etc. 

At the basic level we all know for a fact that identification is required for all these things. 

Now why is Aadhar number & card (as a proof od identity and residence) worse than pan-card, license, passport, ration-card, electricity-bill, phone-bill, bpl card, bank statement etc? 

If just one single card/identification-proof works for most-things (where we need identification/authentication) why is it bad?

Is it an issue with us being **forced**? Like there is no compulsion to own/have any of the identifications like pan-card etc, I mentioned above, but we are indirectly being pushed to have Aadhar cards? 

But there again for various stuff we have been forced to get these cards. Like a pan-card is not compulsory in theory but becomes so when you start earning. Or a passport, license, ration-card under different circumstances. 

**Biometrics** - It eases the authorization/identification and reduces the chances of frauds and scams. mobile banking transactions might actually become more secure with these. 

**Misuse**- This is a concern which is very valid. But how and under what circumstances? Are we looking at real threats or just far-fetched fiction?

**Methodologies adopted by the govt** - As the OP mentioned that the way Aadhar Bill was passed and there is clause which can enable the govt to make changes aren't really kocher. However, aren't we mixing up the two things. What's done and how it got done are two different subjects. Wrong way does not make Aadhar itself wrong. 

Happy to change my opinion. Is there an NGO where I can donate which would fight against Aadhaar in Supreme Court? I will not take Aadhaar unless the SC says there is no way out. > other purposes

> other technology safeguards

So, I bothered checking out section 23.

Subsection 1 puts execution of process of issue completely in the ""authority's"" hands.

Clause (t) of subsection 2 goes like this --
>(t) such other powers and functions as may be prescribed.

Are you fucking kidding me? So the existing govt can do whatever the hell it wants with UID data.

All hell breaks loose if something open to interpretation like ""other"" creeps into contract or tender documents. Too bad we don't subject legislative bills to same standards. will resists getting this card as much as posible, lets see how long we can survive Let's just wait till the database get hacked, as some self-important Babu was too self-important and missed the deadline to submit two notorized copies of the form for updating the OS and anti spyware on the servers for better protection, and the Parliamentary Appropriations Subcommittee for Software Services to Adhar and Other Purposes doesn't retroactively allow any software updates until the next budget cycle.  How well is our database secured and who is privy to this information is the big question.  Such a complicated situation. If this was in the hands of a more unbiased government (like uh... uh...) I'd feel safer. This + smart city initiative is really panning out to be an Orwellian landscape. I can't tell if it's just the usual tech paranoia of things changing rapidly and people remaining as good/bad as they already are, or the possibility of an intense dictatorship.

Good thing the Indian govt is shitty at execution! Adhaar ~ ""Aam aadmi ka adhikaar"" my ass. The ""wild wild west"" days of technology are over. It is slowly being institutionalized using Aadhaar and other means. IMO this was a predictable step in the trend of adoption of modern tools for progress of the country.

You may call it a trojan but I say this is the govt's equivalent to a google/facebook tracking cookie. To serve the best interests of all participants, Aadhar needs to be omniscient and omnipresent. I am glad that Aadhar is the defacto identification system. If the Govt makes it the only number or identification required that would be even better.                  
Privacy is a boogeyman argument. Some institution has to have a list of people who are Indians or living in India,  which is obviously the government.  If anyone wants to transact with the government or society needs to have an identification.  That's the basic requirement.  I suppose it is free and doesn't require renewal or running around to get one.           
It is a good approach to prototype in small areas of government schemes before widening it further. Provides opportunities for scaling and error corrections. Nothing sneaky about it.         
It is entirely voluntary as well. There is no forced drive to enrol anyone.           
Only issue with Aadhar is they could have made it into citizenship proof.         
Glad to see there are technical progress into making Aadhar compatible tablets and mobiles.           
Very good initiative. Why there is no PIL in the Supreme Court? Ah, not-again the conspiracy theorists & luddites !

Look, lets get 2 things straight - which you probably would agree with too

1) To improve efficiency & governance, it helps a lot if every citizen has a unique ID.

2) NO system can be risk free, there will always be ways to break it. The best the architects can do, is to make the breaches difficult


Now, if you agree with #1, then you need to accept #2 as acceptable risk.

If you disagree with #1, then you probably don't understand how e-governance works. If you want to know what real constant surveillance is then open your Google dashboard. Locations, voice search, market targeting and now there is this ""ok Google""  the phone is constantly listening.  I bet NSA has a back door to everything.  Providing Adhar as a proof gives immediate results, try doing it for your next sim card.
If not doing any illegal things, then why worry about privacy. The data ending up in wrong hands is only valid worry, and is called a breach. Irctc having a breach turned out fake. Sure govt has a full proof contract with data management provider. Your freedom and your privacy is not because of lack of technology. It's because we the people have decided to govern ourselves this way.

Every year I keep hearing talks of IIMs wanting to be more like foreign b-schools where majority of the batch does not hail from an engineering background, but from commerce/business backgrounds. But it's not just about MBA programs. Even the batch profile of the Msc Finance program at JBIMS reveals that out of the 30 students it takes in, majority have engineering background.


I appeared for the interview at JBIMS. I'm a BBA - Finance grad and was asked what subjects I studied in BBA. I told them the subjects (Management accounting, strategic financial managemnt, etc.) and they countered asking, ""If you have already studied these subjects in graduation, why do you want to study them again in post grad?"". And here I thought that it would make more sense for business and commerce grads to pursue an MFin because that is much more coherent than jumping over to MFin from engineering.

Interesting article written by an Indian Economist

Japanese save a lot. They do not spend much. Also, Japan exports far more than it imports. Has an annual trade surplus of over 100 billion. Yet Japanese economy is considered weak, even collapsing.

Americans spend, save little. Also US imports more than it exports.
Has an annual trade deficit of over $400 billion. Yet, the American economy is considered strong and trusted to get stronger.

But where from do Americans get money to spend? They borrow from Japan, China and even India.
Virtually others save for the US to spend. Global savings are mostly invested in US, in dollars.

India itself keeps its foreign currency assets of over $50 billion in US securities. China has sunk over $160 billion in US securities.
Japan's stakes in US securities is in trillions.

Result:
The US has taken over $5 trillion from the world. So, as the world
saves for the US - It's The Americans who spend freely. Today, to keep the US consumption going, that is for the US economy to work, other
countries have to remit $180 billion every quarter, which is $2
billion a day, to the US!

A Chinese economist asked a neat question. Who has invested more, US in China, or China in US? The US has invested in China less than half of what China has invested in US.

The same is the case with India. It have invested in US over $50
billion. But the US has invested less than $20 billion in India.

Why the world is after US?

The secret lies in the American spending, that they hardly save. In fact they use their credit cards to spend their future income. That the US spends is what makes it attractive to export to the US. So US imports more than what it exports year after year.

The result:

The world is dependent on US consumption for its growth. By its deepening culture of consumption, the US has habituated the world to
feed on US consumption. But as the US needs money to finance its consumption, the world provides the money.

It's like a shopkeeper providing the money to a customer so that the customer keeps buying from the shop. If the customer will not buy, the shop won't have business, unless the shopkeeper funds him. The US is like the lucky customer. And the world is like the helpless shopkeeper
financier.

Who is America's biggest shopkeeper financier? Japan of course. Yet it's Japan which is regarded as weak. Modern economists complain that
Japanese do not spend, so they do not grow. To force the Japanese to spend, the Japanese government exerted itself, reduced the savings
rates, even charged the savers. Even then the Japanese did not spend (habits don't change, even with taxes, do they?). Their traditional postal savings alone is over $1.2 trillion. Thus, savings, far from being the strength of Japan, has become its pain.

Hence, what is the lesson?

That is, a nation cannot grow unless the people spend, not save. Not just spend, but borrow and spend.
Dr. Jagdish Bhagwati, the famous Indian-born economist in the US, told Manmohan Singh that Indians wastefully save. Ask them to spend, on imported cars and, seriously, even on cosmetics! This will put India on a growth curve. This is one of the reason for MNC's coming down to India, seeing the consumer spending.

'Saving is sin, and spending is virtue.'
But before you follow this Neo Economics, get some fools to save so that you can borrow from them and spend !!!

1.""In November 1998, the day after the Japanese Government announced a large-scale fiscal stimulus to its ailing economy, Moody’s Investors Service began the first of a series of downgradings of the Japanese Government’s yen-denominated bonds, by taking the Aaa (triple A) rating away. The next major Moody’s downgrade occurred on September 8, 2000.

Then, in December 2001, Moody’s further downgraded the Japan Governments yen-denominated bond rating to Aa3 from Aa2. On May 31, 2002, Moody’s Investors Service cut Japan’s long-term credit rating by a further two grades to A2, or below that given to Botswana, Chile and Hungary.

In a statement at the time, Moody’s said that its decision “reflects the conclusion that the Japanese government’s current and anticipated economic policies will be insufficient to prevent continued deterioration in Japan’s domestic debt position … Japan’s general government indebtedness, however measured, will approach levels unprecedented in the postwar era in the developed world, and as such Japan will be entering ‘uncharted territory’.”

The then Japanese Finance Minister responded (with some foresight): “They’re doing it for business. Just because they do such things we won’t change our policies … The market doesn’t seem to be paying attention.” Indeed, the Government continued to have no problems finding buyers for their debt, which is all yen-denominated and sold mainly to domestic investors. 
How … could a country that receives foreign aid from Japan have a better rating than Japan itself? Japan, with an economy almost 1,000 times the size of Botswana’s, has the world’s largest foreign reserves, $446 billion; the world’s largest domestic savings, $11.4 trillion; and about $1 trillion in overseas investments. And 95 percent of the debt is held by Japanese people 

In the New York Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/business/international-business-japan-battles-bond-rating.html] the logic of the rating was questioned:

    It may just be me, but aren’t the credit rating agencies supposed to be rating credit?

    Yesterday, we saw a sharp market reaction when one of the rating agencies that gave AAA ratings to mortgage-backed securities larded with subprime loans called into question the credit worthiness of Britain. As is the case with the United States and the Federal Reserve, Britain and its Bank of England have the ability to create new money if necessary to pay off its debt at maturity. There is no sovereign credit risk. There is no need for credit rating agencies to opine on the credit worthiness of sovereign debt.

    Sovereign debt is subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates in general rise, outstanding bonds, sovereign and non-sovereign, will decline in price, the extent depending on how close they are to maturity.

    Sovereign debt is also subject to inflation risk. Holders of the debt are harmed if inflation outpaces their expectations when they purchased the debt.

    When Standard & Poor questions British bonds, they must be making a judgment about some risk other than credit risk. Given time, investors will learn to take such questions with a grain of salt and not overreact. Meanwhile, haven’t they done enough harm for this cycle?""

Credit agencies carry out work to determine the worthiness or otherwise of financial investments.

They have been accused of failing to spot the size and risk of the bad US housing debt that was resold around the world, causing multi-billion-pound losses.

It was the discovery of these losses that caused the global credit markets to freeze up, and ultimately led to governments around the world having to bail out their banking sectors.

The ratings agencies said that credit ratings were just one factor that investors should look at when making investment decisions, but admitted that less sophisticated investors may have been over-reliant on their assessments.

The committee also criticised the agencies for failing to warn their clients adequately of the problems faced by the Icelandic economy before its banks collapsed last year.

8. Moody's And Japan - But think about the Moodys statement in relation to Japan. The logic (and that is being kind) goes like this:

             1. Economic growth is low in Japan and is pushing tax revenue down and welfare spending up – hence the budget deficit rises.

              2. Given the Japanese government doesn’t exercise its legal right to spend without issuing debt to match the spending, the rising budget deficit (as a result of the cyclical downturn) also means rising public debt.

             3. Moodys asserts (with no analytical or conceptual basis provided) that these rising deficits are in some way a problem per se (rather than being a reflection of the real problem – slow growth).

            4. So in their Pavlovian fashion, they downgrade the credit rating presumably suggesting the Japanese government is a credit risk without acknowledging the Japanese government can never be an credit risk unless there is a collective brain explosion and the Government legislates to renege on its financial obligations.

            5. They downgrade because the slow growth makes it more difficult to reduce the budget deficit without acknowledging that the budget deficit should increase to meet the challenge of slow growth.

           6. But then you are left to ask two questions. First, the Moodys logic would suggest they want to increase the borrowing costs of the Japanese government by reducing the demand for bonds (because the lower rating is meant to scare investors) which if you believed their type of reasoning would further negatively impact on economic growth. So what sort of logic is that? Moodys (if you had their model outlook) is saying the Japanese economy is damaged because of the recession but we are going to make it worse and therefore worsen the problem of credit risk.

           7. Second, of-course, neither their implicit notion that Japanese government debt carries a credit risk or that their ratings change anything anyway are valid. Note that a sign that government paper was not an attractive investment prospect might be rising yields as investors avoided demanding the paper. But Moodys acknowledges that there is an “undiminished home bias of Japanese investors and their preference for government bonds, which allows the government’s fiscal deficits to be funded at the lowest nominal rates globally”.

So who would you bet on? A corrupt capitalist firm that has made some monumental mistakes in the past while handing out AAA ratings to firms who were paying them to rate their products or millions of investors who every day purchase Japanese government debt at stable and the lowest yields? The same investors who have been buying Japanese government debt while deficits have been rising and public debt ratios heading up beyond 200 per cent (compared to the ridiculous Reinhardt Rogoff default threshold of 80 per cent) for the last 20 years.""

8. ""What mindless rule is being applied here?

The whole thing is mindless. To repeat, the logic appears to be: Cut deficits to keep the Aaa rating – but that would undermine growth and push up the deficit and debt – which undermines the Aaa rating.

And the politicians and everyone else goes along with this nonsense. We really are not a very bright race of people.""

715,Business/Finance,"awesome writeup! thank you for taking the time to make the jargon clear to us! While bad on paper - the current scenario is actually better than expected.

The fact that banks have bad loans is an ancient fact of life - these loans extend to many many places, from large firms to small farmers.

It was always expected that some government, would have to intervene ecentually to fix this. It's the NDA who has to handle it, and I fully expect them to handle it. The issue itself is resolved by the bureaucrats and the bankers, with the GoI firmly in the driving seat.

But the issue is always the release of bank funds as largesse. It's a mainstay of Indian politics, in one form or the other. One of the ""unspoken rules"" of the game so far.

The divestiture of PSUs, or stronger oversight/capital norms as a means to constrain loans will help. 

The clean up of banks will be a good thing, and it will allow for loan cycle to occur on the base of a healthy banking sector, which can handle any future negative shock.

Honestly, this is business as expected. It's good that people are upset, but being upset won't make a difference since this is essentially a cyclical feature of the larger economy and our banking/private network.

Rules which are followed, divestment, distance between center/politics and PSU management are the cure - and they've been the cure since the reform process started, but haven't been completed.
 I can add few points on The Banks. My Dad is a Chief Manager of a Public Sector Bank in a Municipal Town based in TN.

Branch Managers/Chief Managers don't like having NPAs on their books either. The problem stems from the Zonal Level. The Zonal Manager assigns quarterly/yearly loan targets to individual branches. Applications for larger (and possibly good) loans that are forwarded to the zonal managers sit on their desks for several weeks, the borrower usually moves on to a Private Bank. Now all that's left is smaller loan applications from shaky applicants, local politicians who wants to build schools/engineering colleges, and activists who would threaten to 'Write to the FM' (This happened a lot during the PC era).  The Zonal Management, despite being sloppy, still expects the Branch Managers to meet the targets. So BMs give the loan and hope it would not become a NPA before they get transferred, so that the live bomb is passed on to the new guy.
With a bit of negotiation with the auditing team and the zonal management, you can avoid declaring few loans as NPA for a bunch of quarters. 

Oh, and I don't even want to speak about the crazy ones that retire as Branch Managers. They go on a loaning spree. Thanks a lot. This is some major issue which no one seems to care about in media. I have been telling this to friends and family and actually no one really cares. 

What concerns me is the part where they might bail out these rich-ass people with public money. That will be unjust. These people have the means to pay back and yet they take advantage of out easy recovery norms.

Irony is banks wouldn't write-off agricultural or small loans as these people are easier to bully and that will result in farmer suicides.

But they are happy to go with all the loss because somewhere we have lenient norms and these wigwigs are the ones who control our economic policies.

Edit: **[The Hindu Editorial on this issue](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/no-bailout-with-taxpayer-money/article8241268.ece)**
 Loans being written off from the books or provisions being kept against bad debt doesn't mean that there won't be recovery. The whole Raghuram Rajan point in the opening post doesn't make sense. That would be like blaming a government which enforces accurate reporting of crimes for increase in crime statistics.

The lowly bank managers have little say in large loans. The decision for the biggest NPAs are taken at least at General Manager level (some even at Chairman level). One needs to investigate these bad loans, seize the assets of willful defaulters and charge the real decision-makers in bank.

The whole issue is that of bankers being browbeaten to give risky debt to industrialists with political connections and the said industrialists refusing to pay up because they know that they have the connections and the power to avoid being hit by any action taken by common bank bankers (different ones from those who gave them loans). Great writeup. Thanks.    
A question: Big corporates (say Vijay Mallya) take huge loans and then are not able to pay back and thus the write off. What does the law do here? Can't it catch the culprits and send them to jail? Or probably auction the properties that were kept as a guarantee while taking loan? I haven't heard of a bigshot (except Sahara) who is sent to Jail for not paying back the money.  Vijay Mallaya is a free man and they fucked up my credit score because i missed one payment on my education loans.

 yenna rascals i tell ya.  > On top of it, Vijay Mallya just resigned from United Spirits and got a payout of $515 million.

Rs515cr not $million. Pedantic but couldn't resist because of my intermittent OCD. sorry. 

>How can they ask the banks to waive off loans worth lakhs of crores without having an estimate of how the big defaulters are?

The Banks know who are the borrowers and RBI does not, so this is not an issue. 

Secondly, the loans are not being waived (as in cancelled or forgiven/forgotten). That's a wrong and dangerous word to use in this context. 

The loans are being written off. What that means is, as you say earlier in you post, that once the borrower has failed to service the loan (willingly or due to the things he can't control) the banks write-off (called provisioning; could be partial or full) that in their P&L and Balance Sheet to show the true reflection of their own health (Rajan is pushing for aggressive approach, as you mention later in the post). That does not mean that the borrower walks away. The Banks continue to make efforts to recover the money (through notices, public-shaming, selling assets of borrower, change of management, restructuring, conversion into equity, court-cases, sale of loan to ARCs etc). If a loan (or part of that) has been written off by the bank, and the bank manages to recover it, the amount is written back and becomes a profit for that year. 

An interesting example here would be the business cycle of mid 90s-early 2000s. At that time also the banks faced huge defaults and were actually in a worse shape than today. But fortunately the global commodity prices shot through the roof and most of the bank clients turned around and Banks averted a disaster. Most borrowers were commodity companies at that time (steel, cement etc). 

This time this is not likely to happen. So the mess wouldn't clear itself up. 

> They could have taken measure to make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money,

Not only did they not take these measures they actually forced the Banks to lend to their *favored* borrowers. one of the biggest defaulter is Unitech, which people say is a Gandhi-family company (rumor; don't ask for source). JP group another big defaulter was close to BSP, Jindals to Congress, HCC to Pawar, DLF to Huda/Vadra and so on. 

> They will benefit immensely from this loan write-off and bailouts.

If the government/banks play by the book (which is a big ask) they need not. Seize their fucking assets. If they have given a personal guarantee, seize their homes too. 

> So what happens next?

Short term- Government puts equity into the banks and they somehow survive

Medium term- Hopefully this Government puts professional management into the top layers of the bank (Board and CMD) and the rot is contained. It is happening in Bank Of Baroda but again a tall ask

Long term- The relative size of the PSU bank will shrink, pvt banks will become bigger. 

One last point. Why are politicians reluctant in reforming or privatizing the Banks? Because that is the biggest tool of granting favors to corporates who in turn are the biggest political donors. 

The last last point. There is a Silver lining, The bank's problem is a stock-problem i.e. the loans already given are going bad and we need to deal with it. What the system does not have, fortunately, is the 'flow' problem ie new money is coming into the system and if the investment cycle picks up, we will have the money to fund it.  Relevant Documentary: **[Overdose: The Next Financial Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ECi6WJpbzE)** It is really appreciated that we have people like you who are willing to be frank about such situations. >Kingfisher Airlines borrowed an amount of Rs 7000 crore from 17 banks. These loans were declared as NPA and **the recoverable amount has come to a mere Rs 6 crore.** Go figure how much will be recovered from the 4.4 lakh crore.

The reason why this happened is because Mallaya used the trademarks and labels of kingfisher as collateral with the banks. But the value of these trademarks crashed when kingfisher went bankrupt. Now this goes without saying that a brand name would lose its value if it goes bankrupt, so why did banks took the risk of taking kingfisher trademarks as collateral in the first place when the loan was being taken for the vary same corporation.


>The bench headed by Chief Justice asked,

>It is all there in this Indian Express report.

Well, that's strange!

Is supreme court bench drawing its conclusions from a newspaper's report?
 I always post this lecture/article by Rajan on the topic of attitude of borrowers towards the bank. www.outlookindia.com/article/we-need-a-change-in-mind-set/292696

> The average interest rate on loans to the power sector today is 13.7% even while the policy rate is 8%. The difference, also known as the credit risk premium, of 5.7% is largely compensation banks demand for the risk of default and non-payment. Since the unscrupulous promoter hides among the scrupulous ones, every businessperson is tainted by the bad eggs in the basket. Even comparing the rate on the power sector loan with the average rate available on the home loan of 10.7%, it is obvious that even good power sector firms are paying much more than the average household because of bank worries about whether they will recover loans. Reforms that lower this 300 basis point risk premium of power sector loans vis-a-vis home loans would have large beneficial effects on the cost of finance, perhaps as much or more than any monetary policy accommodation.

Also highlights general problems like regulatory forbearance which was put in place for temporary use but has been abused again and again. - www.livemint.com/Opinion/RbcTUBqQfY7MOqW4uyTQ7H/Why-regulatory-forbearance-must-end.html

Recovery rates of PSBs are lower than Private sector banks but the latter's isn't all that higher either (25%), we need better bankruptcy laws to deal with this. 

cc /u/kumbhakaran you may want to add these links if you find them useful/insightful. >Through some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft, the managers have been sitting on this pile of rotting loans. They didn't have any reason to tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were in. Until Rajan sent them that notice and forced them to declare these bad loans

It is not possible for the manger to hide bad loans as periodical review of all the accounts is done. 

Many of the bad loans have till now been prevented from being classified as NPAs by refinancing them with short term loans to avoid defaults. The RBI has now asked them to classify even such loans as bad loans. Also under consortium lending even if one member bank recognizes an account as NPA, all the banks are now required to treat the account as NPA which was not the case earlier. Both of these are major causes for the higher NPA numbers

It is the top management which is responsible for the current mess and not just the front end manager who in most of the cases is just following orders from the top. two very improtant numbers are missing 

1)  when you say 4.4 lakh cores in Non Performing Assets (NPAs)...what is the total out standing loan amounts outstanding for all banks concerned...only then can we say what percentage of total loans are NPA's....i can see that 4.4 lakh cores seems like lot but it will not make any sense until we see what how much of the total loaned out amount are NPA's.....

2) also what are the total deposits help for all bank concerned?.......

when these two numbers are understood then this issue wont be as dire as it seems....

all banks world over has NPA's...its the nature if the business..as long as the overall loans are managed well then we will be okay Can some one shed some light of why lots of big corporations defaulting? Indian economy is doing very good. Some companies are doomed to fail,  but in good economic situation there should be more successful than failed ones.  Umm sir why should government cover for the banks? How about a radical idea: Get government out of banking, let the public banks fail if they have to.

Modi promised divestment and reducing the size of the government. Government acquiring the bad loans of banks is completely opposite. Hope he sticks to his principles and stated promises. Anyone know about this?

Big corporate companies & PSU's take loan from foreign banks based outside of India, because they have near-zero interest rates. It's basically called External Commercial Borrowings (ECB)

Does the issue of NPA's exist in ECB too?  If possible, have Mr Satpathy ask a question in the question hour to Mr. Finance Minister about how the government plans to deal with these NPAs and where that money will come out of. This is what Make in India initiative will be twisted for. Just pledging an investment for so and so money. 

Whether they have expertise in that field or they are company which is not running in losses or a company with a history of bad loans or whether they will actually follow thorough, won't be observed at all. 

They will strong arm the banks to provide loans which they will use for their own company purposes. 

Check who are the highest defaulters currently are: Essar, Reliance, Adani, Vedanta, GVK. 

You think they will pay it off? Not a chance, they will use make in India as leverage, investment as a collateral, and continue bleeding ~~banks~~ PSBs.  You are welcome
http://www.moneyreformsindia.org/ Excellent write up /u/kumbhakaran with great inputs from /u/ribiy, I highly appreciate these kind of informative posts. Great read boss. A very fine write up.

A majority of those loans are actually the **'infrastructure loans'** that the corporates(majority of them private ones) took, mostly from the PSBs and then because of one reason or another(land acquisition, environmental clearances, etc.) weren't able to earn enough and in time to pay back.

Now, as the interest that they are supposed to pay, changes(increases, usually) every year(*notwithstanding the fact that the corporates usually factor in the interest risk factor during the initial years of the start of the project but because such projects provide returns for some 30-40 years on an average - like tollbooths on the highways - its usually a risk that pays off eventually*), if the project is stalled, the interest starts piling up. Inflation and falling rupee worsen the impact. 

I read today - [304 plans worth Rs 12,75,877 crore stuck; stalled projects continue to haunt policymakers](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/304-plans-worth-rs-1275877-cr-stuck-stalled-projects-continue-to-haunt-policymakers/)

There are a few measures that the current government did take last year, both on the revenue and the expense sides. One I remember is [Indradhanush](http://currentaffairs.gktoday.in/union-government-unveils-indradhanush-mission-psbs-08201525782.html) which aims to introduce a bit of corporatism in the management(and consequentially affecting the processes of verification of claims, disbursement of funds and monitoring of paybacks) of the Public Sector Banks of the country which were behaving like they were throwing a *langar* in a gurudwara. 

An impending [Bankruptcy Law](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/market-outlook/india-staring-at-banking-crisis-bankruptcy-law-crucial-sanger_5410401.html) and [Debt Restructuring measures](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/c-p-chandrasekhar/saving-indias-public-sector-banks/article7392418.ece) might also help better the dire situation. Banks are not in trouble, our savings are in trouble.  > they have to clean up the mess

Modi can privatize the banks but the truth nobody has the balls to do it. Well now the fall in oil is a blessing in disguise for India. We don't have to print money to bail these banks out. Instead the govt is keeping the petrol prices high in part to pay for the subsidies provided when oil was upwards of $100/barrel and partly for the economic mess UPA1&2 left behind That's a very intelligent writing, but surprised to link Kingfisher Airline loss to Vijay Mallya. If he did some thing illegal like diverting funds from Kingfisher airlines to his personal accounts those kinds of activities are illegal and banks should go after his personal money. As a corporation setup he might have invested some of his money in it and some other individual's or corporation who got shares of the corporation.  Banks gave loan to that corporation betting on that success so banks could get portion of that success too. Some of those investmen's bound to fail just like any other investment and that's the risk they are taking. Banks are supposed to do honest evaluation of business model and management when they gave loan. 
 Shouldn't they consider more revenue from income tax and also implement drastic measures like cash transaction tax ( http://m.ndtv.com/profit/government-to-not-implement-banking-transaction-tax-712227) to bring more money into system ? What's the chance of my education loan being rejected?  OP, do you have information about a sector breakup of these NPA? If the exact names of the big defaulters are not known, is the statistics known?

I will also be interested in knowing how much of this NPA was loaned to GOI agencies like Air India. 

Edit: Thanks for the writeup. It's lucid. I know this first hand. One of my friends in SBI , a credit analyst objected to a big loan to a very poorly managed company.
But,eventually he got bullied by the sales teams and had to approve.
I remember that he got a silver ganesha worth at least 25k..the bank head got a golden ganesha as ""thank you gift""
The system is f***ed for good Good ELI5, but a few bad points.

1. Raghu is just as much to be blamed as the doctor that is operating on you now that you drunk so much that you crashed your bike on the street.

2. Manmohan and UPA are the biggest culprits since they forced the banks to give loans to corporate entities that were close to them (and likely Sonia and co were in on the take)

3. Supreme Court - When they do get a chance to pull the biggies down (looking at you, Sonia and Rahul in case of national Herald, or PC in case of Vasan Eyecare) - they pull the last punches, and thus feeding the ""too big to fail"" mindset.

4. Modi - Under Modi's term, the incremental borrowing has practically shrunk. They have no legislative control on the banks, as the banks report into the RBI from a regulatory standpoint. Bank appointees coming from Fin Secy is the only tangential link. Could Modi merge and privatize all these banks? Sure, that is something that I hope they do!

5. Big corporates - They are not to be blamed. They are sucking the system dry since they are being allowed to. Can you blame a tiger for eating up your dog? If you cannot keep your dog on the leash and a big gun nearby - it is not tiger's fault, it is its nature. Crooks will try to steal money. Bailouts and capital infusement are not the same.

The former involves the Treasury buying loans from banks with cash (that they inturn got from taxes or borrowing through bonds)

The latter involves the govt investing in the banks that it owns to acquire more assets. Nothing about loans.

So, this alone makes rest of the argument invalid.  >To put it simply: The taxpayer gets f'ed in the a. As always.

I disagree. The [ARCs](http://www.indiafilings.com/learn/asset-reconstruction-company-arc-india/) take up most of the NPAs and make a profit (management fee!) on recovering bad loans (vasooli) ! Thanks for the post, man.  Most of these bad loans are secured loans meaning there's a property or company assets that are mortgaged. Right now it is a pain in the ass for banks to recover NPA loans through the SARFAESI act. I hope the rules are simplified so that willing defaulters can face the consequences they deserve.  Why can't loan defaulters be forced to declare bankruptcy and the bank then can pay off their creditors using the defaulter's assets? Bailing out is not an option because then the banks would continue to give out bad loans. One of the big reason for this is very high interest rates (15-18%) in our country. Business margins are shrinking. Most companies are finding it hard to repay interest on loan, forget the principal.

Bankruptcy laws in India are very complicated. Actually they don't exist in the form they exist in Western countries. I have heard of so many stories of businessmen taking huge loans from banks and then fixing the system to never repay it or only a partial amount. The entire machinery works to make this system very efficient, including, politicians, bank employees, businessmen, accountants and middle men. Individuals do well while we collectively are screwed. relevant info  Reported this article to rbi at their contact us page. 

                          \__(^_^)__/  **Blame**

1. Raghuram Rajan - NO. He is only doing what should have been done long time back. If NPAs were allowed to go unchecked, most of them would have eaten up the system and even more bailout money at a later date. As of now we are already in a global recession/slow growth, so this is the right time to absorb the losses rather than carrying it forward and having it crash a bull market.

2. UPA - YES. They made hay with jobless inflationary growth while pocketing huge sums between themselves. Too bad there's no political accountability, the least we should do is pressure them to stop putting obstructions in the reform process. I'm looking at you /u/tathagatasatpathy /u/kumbhakaran 

3. NDA-II - NO. Capital infusion to PSBs is required to offset the shitstorm. See the BoB 12 Feb jump in share price: http://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE:BANKBARODA. this was because they declared huge amounts of NPA. Now this is one bank which won't need any bailout in the near future. All banks must come clean with as much NPA as they can clean up. This, combined with the Bankrupty Bill, will allow quick cleanup, larger than usual recovery in cases where assets are still there, and we can move on with a clean conscience.

4. Banks. YES/NO - while the systems there are still alright, banks need to get rid of front desks which give loans for bribes. This should be a simple task. Look at the list of approving officers. Finds officers whose sanctions have disproportionately gone in the red, fire them, put cases against them and let I-T handle the rest.

5. Big Corporations - YES. Same as the officers above: find chronic defaulters, black list them, file cases against them as appropriate, and let appropriate authorities handle the rest.

6. *Common Man* - YES. There was a post yesterday asking for ideas on how the common man can help India grow. *Don't give or take bribes.* As simple as that. And this is probably harder than the 5 above. Didn't the SBI sanction a 1 billion loan for Adani? Good learning info for SSC CGL exam. ",1456482711.0,1,93,0,421,"Amidst the prolonged JNU controversy &amp; Jat Quota stir, one big development is constantly being ignored for the past two weeks. Our Banks (PSBs) have declared they have [4.4 lakh crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/at-rs-4-lakh-crore-bad-loans-exceed-market-value-of-psu-banks/articleshow/51078318.cms) worth Non Performing Assets (NPAs) as of December 2015. 

Here, I will attempt to break it all down in layman terms. What, why, when and how it affects us, the taxpayer. I'm no finance expert, so please point out any errors I make. I had to go through a lot of complicated jargon (it's weird how these things are always so complicated) to make sense of it.

**What are NPAs and why should we care?**

Loans whose three consecutive installments are not paid are classified as Non Performing Assets (NPAs). After an NPA or bad loan is declared, the bank can initiate the process of recovery and restructuring of that loan. It will try to get new management to run projects, auction off collateral and try to recover the amount, which is rarely equivalent to the amount of loan given. Especially in case of big loans. 

The NPAs that have been declared recently are mostly by big corporate borrowers (according to some sources, around 65-70% of total defaulters are big corps). Take the example of Vijay Mallaya. Kingfisher Airlines borrowed an amount of Rs 7000 crore from 17 banks. These loans were declared as NPA and the recoverable amount has come to a mere Rs 6 crore. Go figure how much will be recovered from the 4.4 lakh crore. 

On top of it, [Vijay Mallya just resigned from United Spirits](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/budget/article-vijay-mallya-resigns-from-united-spirits-gets-rs-515-crore-1281435?pfrom=home-lateststories) and got a payout of ~~$515 million~~ Rs 515 crore. Good times for him while the 17 banks unitedly struggle to recover the loan amount. 

**So if the loans can't be recovered, what happens to the banks?** 

Simply put, they register losses, throw up their hands and tell the Government, ""Sorry [boss, can't get these loans back](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/state-run-banks-like-sbi-bank-of-baroda-central-bank-of-india-apprise-pm-narendra-modi-of-rising-bad-loans/articleshow/50990898.cms). We need to make profits. Pliss to help."" 

**What will the Government do about this?**

One word: Bailout. 
This whole thing is turning into a big cluster fuck. 'Sources' have been saying the government is planning to infuse Rs 70,000 crore till 2019 into PSBs to calm things down. They have already infused Rs 20,000 crore this year. This amount will not help banks deal with the problem in totality but it's a temporary measure to ensure they don't just collapse under the weight of NPAs. 

**Does that Government have enough money to save the banks?**

No. 

Here's a few things which the government has to spend on in the near future:

1) [Food Security Act](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-02-03/news/70313785_1_national-food-security-act-prime-minister-narendra-modi-food-subsidy) 

2) [MGNREGA](http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2016/02/nda-pursuing-mgnrega-bengal-and-up-election/)

3) [Seventh pay commission](http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/of-the-servants-by-the-servants-for-the-servants/)

5) [Increased Defence allocation](http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2016-17/expert-columns/defence-budget-allocation-likely-to-see-minimum-10-per-cent-hike/story/229336.html)

The revenue, on the other hand, doesn't seem that rosy. The government has [kept the fuel prices high](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/excise-duty-hiked-on-petrol-by-re-1litre-on-diesel-by-rs-1-5/) to get excise duty on it. The finance minister has been saying this is being done to reduce our fiscal deficit, which is fair. But then in that case where will the money for 'capital infusion in banks' come from? 

(I have to point out here that the first two expenditure items I mentioned are something that the present government has avoided spending on much till now. I don't blame them because the GST plan didn't really work out, so they have to go on an appeasement spree to calm their voters.)

**Well, that's all dandy well awesome but who's fault is it?**

This problem, unfortunately, cannot be pinned down on a single person or party. So I've made a list! 

1) *Raghuram Rajan / Reserve Bank of India*

The banks have been more or less forced to declare these loans because Raghuram Rajan sent notices telling them to clean up their balance sheets. He did this so that the banks can start a fresh cycle of loan disbursements to boost investment in the country. It's a good move in the long term but it all depends on whether the banks are in a position to handle the burden at this point of time.

A Supreme Court bench recently [pulled up the RBI to ask WTF is happening](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-debts-rbi-supreme-court-bank-defaulters/). 

&gt; The bench headed by Chief Justice asked, ""People are owing thousands of crore to the public banks… it is a big fraud. Top ten public sector banks have written off Rs 40,000 crore alone in 2015. It is all there in this Indian Express report. Public financial institutions are lending money despite knowing no returns. RBI is supposed to keep a watch on these banks. What are you doing about it?”

They asked RBI to submit a list of defaulters with loans over Rs 500 crore. To which the RBI replied:

&gt; “The required information is not available with us. Banks are required to report the bad loans on a consolidated basis.""

Personally, I find this response really strange because a periodic reporting of big loans is done to both the Finance Ministry and RBI. How can they ask the banks to ~~waive off~~ write-off loans worth lakhs of crores without having an estimate of who the big defaulters are? 

*2) Manmohan Singh / Previous UPA Government*

If anyone is to blame, it's them. These loans which are being declared NPAs have been given during their time. They could have taken measure to make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money, but they didn't. So they have left this huge crumbling mass of debt which is all coming out. Like pus from a wound. Ugh.

*3) Narendra Modi / Present NDA Government*

If this capital infusion a.k.a. bailout continues and the economy gets in trouble, the NDA government will be definitely blamed for it. The whole point is that they are now in power and they have to clean up the mess even if they want to blame the previous government for it. The people will not forgive the BJP for a major (possibly catastrophic) economic downturn, no matter who is responsible for it. 

Modi has projected himself, right from the beginning, as the savior of the economy. Now that the economy is facing a challenge, he can't afford to point fingers at UPA. But he will, he most definitely will. Rightfully so, but that won't help matters at all.

*4) Faceless, nameless / The Banks*

Aah yes. These frikkin Bankers. The biggest culprits are the bank managers who are responsible for due diligence before disbursing loans. If there is an NPA in a particular bank branch, the manager is held responsible for it. In case of big loans, the top management has to give approvals and they are also held responsible. 

Through some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft, the managers have been sitting on this pile of rotting loans. They didn't have any reason to tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were in. Until Rajan sent them that notice and forced them to declare these bad loans. 

*5) Big Corporates*

The usual suspects. They will benefit immensely from this loan write-off and bailouts. Just like Vijay Mallya did. They have, in the past decade or so, taken a lot of loans which are now proving to be bad assets for the banks. Even the Economic survey has pointed out that these [corporate debts are worrisome](http://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/perspective/economic-survey-corporate-debts-consumer-spend-monsoons/story/229607.html). They have called it 'The Twin Balance Sheet Problem'... which makes no sense to me...

Some projects haven't taken off due to land acquisition issues, Infrastructure problems and environmental clearances. There is limited investment coming in from abroad. Therefore, the government was eager to push GST and all of these investment driving schemes for the past two years. Didn't really work out as they planned. Even if they manage to pave the way for these pending projects, the corporations are known to delay and milk them for maximum profits. (Eg: KG Basin, IGI Airport and many more.) 

**So what happens next? Also, TLDR.**

To put it simply: The taxpayer gets f'ed in the a. As always.

EDIT 2: Gold! Thank you kind stranger. ",Our Banks are in trouble & we need to talk about it
716,Business/Finance,"This is brilliant. Has there been any media coverage at all about FDI in politics? This could change the way crony capitalism in this country works.  >BJP & Congress: Secretive Team Players

>Not a single word about the FCRA amendment was spoken that day. Just like that, a super important law that will change how our political parties are funded, was accepted by the Lok Sabha.

Proof if any needed, that BJP & Congress are no different from each other! They'll join hands and throw out democracy if it benefited them.

>The ‘Jumla’ that escaped

Not just a 'jumla' but the likes of 'scam' that this very BJP govt chased Congress out of power!

In 2005, then CM Modi abruptly announced that the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) had discovered 20 trillion cubic feet of gas in KG basin (that the BJP promptly renamed the Deendayal West area block), which would generate revenue worth Rs. 2.2 lakh crore for India! Everyone (including the state and central administrations as well as subject experts) was astonished at this fantastic claim. 

If true, such a find would have made India energy self-sufficient, a must for any country aspiring for super power status. Modi’s announcement therefore generated euphoric excitement and even shifted the narrative from him being the alleged mastermind of the 2002 riots to a potential Prime Ministerial candidate. 

In fact, given how events unfolded, it is abundantly clear that the announcement (like everything else PM Modi does) was just another exaggerated publicity stunt.

 Modiji pays heed exclusively to his own mann ki baat! He thus ignored the field report, and forced GSPC to go ahead with the project. Because of this, GSPC borrowed nearly Rs 20,000 crore from 15 different public and private sector banks. And what does India have in return? Nothing! 

But the issue is not just about Modiji’s gaseous exaggerations. It is also about diversion of public funds and corruption. After coercing GSPC to go ahead with drilling in KG basin, CM Modi forced it to partner with a company named Geo Global. Now here’s the interesting bit:

*Geo Global  was reportedly incorporated just six days before the agreement with GSPC. At the time of entering into the agreement with GSPC, Geo Global’s capital was reportedly a measly Rs 3,200. A week after the agreement, its capital mushroomed to Rs 10,000 crore.*

>In its report for the year ended March 31, 2015, tabled in state assembly this year, CAG had pulled up GSPC for its lack of experience as 'overseas operator'. ""The delay in execution of the work committed resulted in cost escalations in overseas blocks. As a result, the company had incurred expenditure of Rs 1,757.46 crore for 10 surrendered blocks, of which Rs 1,734.12 crore has been written off,"" the apex auditor noted.

Was this public money diverted to fund Modi ji’s extravagant 2014 election campaign? Does this not merit an independent high level judicial probe? And even more interestingly, when the screws were tightened on Vijay Mallya for defaulting on Rs. 9000 crore, why is GSPC not being subject to similar treatment? Why is it that instead, its Managing Director was rewarded with an appointment as the [Director of the National Informatics Centre?](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-06-18/news/63568239_1_gujarat-state-petroleum-corporation-deity-gspc)

However, desperately the BJP may sycophantically defend PM Modi, the bitter reality is that under him corruption was rampant in Gujarat. Consider how [he gave 250 acres of land (in a restricted wildlife zone) to cronies of the current CM of Gujarat for less than Rs. 1.5 crore.](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/anandiben-patels-daughter-in-soup-over-gir-sanctuary-land-deal-congress-wants-sit-probe/1/588670.html)

Similarly, [CM Modi gave public land for the Mundra SEZ.](http://www.frontline.in/cover-story/the-great-land-grab/article4666181.ece), which was worth Rs. 1500 per square metre for a pittance (anything between Rs. 01 & Rs. 32) That is why for years, the CAG was deliberately denied access to numerous files in Gujarat. And that is also why under Modi ji, a Lokayukta was not appointed for 10 years.

In his avatar as Prime Ministerial candidate, Modi ji had famously argued “main na khata hoon, na khaane deta hoon”. It seems the truth is different.

#Money Bill strikes again!
___
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a troubled lot. They have an easy majority in Lok Sabha, which allows them to push their bills through, but they don’t have the numbers in Rajya Sabha to do the same. For the past two years, the opposition in the upper house has blocked their legislative agenda through the creative use of their throats and by camping all around the speaker’s grand throne-chair, protesting away to glory. But the Government of the day seems to have a few tricks up its sleeve. They seem to be aiming to completely ignore the upper house by using the [Money Bill route](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/492acw/lets_talk_about_the_new_aadhaar_bill_it_can/). Twice!


The first instance of ‘Operation Money Bill’ was observed on March 11, when the Lok Sabha passed the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016. During the consideration of this bill, many members screamed bloody murder and opposed this legislation being certified as a Money Bill. It went to the Rajya Sabha for recommendations. The bill got passed, 4 days later, on March 16 in its original form. The government of the day seems to have hit Parliament procedure gold. So merely two months later, they decided to do it again.

And this time, it was to bring in FDI in politics!

The Finance Bill 2016 was passed in the Lok Sabha with a clause that did not belong in that legislation, namely, amendments the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA).

#BJP & Congress: Secretive Team Players
___

The FCRA Amendment is a strange one. Earlier foreign companies were not allowed to make donations to political parties. For obvious reasons. Otherwise entities like Monsanto [would have a field day](http://imgur.com/AsZqfLk). 

The logic being that foreign entities should not be able to influence our Parliament to make laws that favor them. In 2014, both BJP and Congress were found guilty by the Delhi High Court of accepting foreign contributions from UK based company Vedanta. So the government of the day decided to deal with it by making a retrospective amendment to the FCRA act by hiding it within the Finance Bill.

This amendment has cleared Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha has no say in it (because, you know, ‘Operation Money Bill’) and the President’s approval will come soon. Say hello to FDI in Politics.

#The Curious Case of Finance Bill, 2016
___
During the debate on the Finance Bill on Wednesday, Asaduddin Owaisi raised a point of order to question the government on the validity of the FCRA amendment. He argued that this act comes under the Home Ministry and amending it through a Finance Bill goes against the provisions of the Constitution. He demanded that the discussion should be suspended immediately since the bill is flawed. 

The decision landed on the lap of deputy speaker of Lok Sabha Arjun Charan Singh, who looked like a dog-lover with a cat in his lap. Unsure what to do. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was away on an official visit to Germany so MoS Jayant Sinha tried to do a [ninja save](http://imgur.com/G9lMcPM). He told Owaisi that Jaitley will respond to his query while replying to the debate.

**[24 hours later](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/e/e8/24_Hours_Later..._.png/revision/latest?cb=20130519222728)**

While giving his reply speech, the Fin Min sort of ignored the FCRA issue. Instead, he spoke about giving funds to the Polavaram Dam. It upset Biju Janata Dal from Orissa enough to stage a rather noisy walkout. The debate ended abruptly and clause by clause on the Finance Bill began. 

Still no word about the point of order despite Owaisi asking the speaker for a ruling.

[Cricket sounds #1](http://imgur.com/DKiZ6Mw)

The Finance Minister had made 49 official amendments to the Finance Bill, so the speaker was going through them one by one. Clause 233, which concerns the controversial FCRA amendment, was clubbed in with Clauses 220 to 230, schedules first to fifteen and passed together.

[Cricket sounds #2](http://imgur.com/wn6P3Mv)

After the clause by clause consideration was completed, the speaker gave a ruling to Owaisi’s point of order and denied it. Ignoring protests from some members, she called for the passage of the bill.

[Cricket sounds #3](http://imgur.com/JxBvCE6)

Not a single word about the FCRA amendment was spoken that day. Just like that, a super important law that will change how our political parties are funded, was accepted by the Lok Sabha. 

The Finance Minister be like [#EpicWin](http://img.memecdn.com/epic-win_o_834502.gif).

#The ‘Jumla’ that escaped
___
Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad raised the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) issue in Rajya Sabha. Jairam Ramesh has written about this extensively in The Hindu ( [Part 1](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/jairam-ramesh-on-the-krishna-godavari-basin-scam/article8486493.ece) & [Part 2](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/comment-article-by-jairam-ramesh-on-the-kg-basin-scam-part-ii/article8533360.ece) ). 
To give you a short rundown of this ‘Jumla’, in 2005 GSPC claimed that the KG Basin had an epic deposit of natural gas worth an estimated Rs. 2,20,000 crore. They spent Rs 19,700 crore over a period of a decade for ‘gas exploration’ but did not get even a tiny whiff of the sweet sweet hydrocarbon gas mixture. Five CAG reports over the past five years have pointed out discrepancies in the way GSPC operated. The Congress has been dying to dig deep into this issue and they finally did it in Rajya Sabha. They took out their shovels, ready to break the earth while singing merry songs of victory.

But then, they struck a rock called Arun Jaitley even before they started digging.

Jaitley told Azad that this issue cannot be raised in Parliament because the [Public Accounts Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee_(India) (PAC) is already examining it. The PAC is a committee of selected members of Parliament, constituted by the Parliament of India, for the auditing of the revenue and the expenditure of the Government of India. The house cannot deliberate on matters that a Parliamentary committee is already deliberating.

#Rule 255: Kick the disrupter
___
Rajya Sabha was yet again disrupted at the beginning of the week over the Agusta Westland issue. Members trooped into the well, shouting garbled slogans against the Government. Then, Rule 255 happened. 

> “The Chairman may direct any member whose conduct is in his opinion grossly disorderly to withdraw immediately from the Council and any member so ordered to withdraw shall do so forthwith and shall absent himself during the remainder of the day's meeting.” [Source](http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rs_rule/generalrulesproc.asp)

Hamid Ansari, Chairman of Rajya Sabha invoked this rule and ordered Sukhendu Roy of the TMC to be removed from the upper house for a day. Roy was seen standing at his seat and demanding (very loudly) to know who benefitted from the Agusta Westland scam. 

Here’s an excerpt from the debate:

[""Please stop making inane noise""](http://imgur.com/JQhbrjq)

[""Please stop talking... or else""](http://imgur.com/vl0UVaB)

[""RULE 255 BITCHES!!! GTFO!""](http://imgur.com/v3kMrpA)

After the Sukhendu Roy left, taking his ‘unauthorized inane noise’ with him, the Congress continued its valiant attempt to stall the proceedings in the house. Nitin Gadkari, visibly upset, requested Ansari to smite them with his awesome legal powers and invoke 255 on all of them. Ansari pointed out that Rule 255 applies only to individual members and cannot be enforced en masse.

#Big Tobacco vs Unhealthy Lung pictures
___
There have been three zero hour notices raised in the Lok Sabha this session regarding increasing health warnings on tobacco products to 85%. To give you some context, the government had passed an order in 2014 which mandated tobacco manufacturers to show gruesome pictures of decaying lungs that cover up to 85% of the product packet. 

The pictures would dissuade new smokers from taking up the deadly cause and it has been proven to be quite effective in many countries around the world. This order was to come into force on April 1 this year and there has been a battle raging between the Tobacco industry and the government on the sidelines. /u/dextermilburn has been talking about ITC shutting down and opening factories [in his posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4inj30/last_week_in_indian_economy_for_the_week_ending/) for a few weeks now. The Parliament also became a stage where this battle is being fought by filing notices in favor and against the government’s move.

Last week on May 3rd, Baijayant Panda raised a zero hour notice supporting the government’s move to increase the warning size. He urged the government to hold its ground on increasing health warnings and to implement its order diligently. 

On 27th April, two other members had raised a notice to oppose the government’s move, namely R Dhruvanarayana and Sharadkumar Bansode. Both of these members spoke about how tobacco farmers and beedi manufacturers will be adversely affected if these warnings are imposed. They wanted the government to consider the plight of the farmers connected to the industry and not impose the order.

Last Wednesday, the Supreme Court had a hearing where upheld the Government’s 2014 order and asked Tobacco companies to implement it.

**What is a Zero Hour and why is it important?**

‘Zero Hour’ refers to a time period in the Parliament when members can raise matters of urgent public importance to bring it to the notice of the government of the day. Every day when the Parliament is in session, there is one hour allotted to raise such notices. A member is required to file the notice in Parliament before 9 a.m. on the same day. A ballot takes place in which notices are randomly selected and are allowed to be raised. In Lok Sabha, the Zero hour usually happens from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and in Rajya Sabha, it happens from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. It’s upto the speakers in both houses to decide the time slot of the zero hour, depending on how heavy the legislative business is.

The Zero hour is easily one of the most ignored aspect of our Parliamentary process. It a perfect way to judge what is on the minds of our elected representatives. For instance, in the past two weeks numerous notices were raised on the water crisis and drought situation in the country. Considering that these notices are randomly selected through a ballot, the sheer volume points towards the fact that this crisis is bigger and badder than we imagine.

717,Business/Finance,">All the news of doom-and-gloom in IT sector is perhaps making families with eligible brides and grooms re-think alliances from those in IT sector.

Now families will start updating their daughter's matrimonial profiles with a new line 

*IT employees kindly don't contact Most of these are related to, ""oh, what will the society think of me"". While I get the importance of fitting into society, and not being an outcast, our incessant desire to be ""approved"" by people is doing us more harm than good. How can a person, going through such a tough time, see an sliver of hope, when their mind is clouded worrying about their perception by others?

Ours is a shallow, judgmental society. They'll celebrate you when you have succeeded according to their standards, but also denigrate and vilify you, when you go through a tough time, like a layoff, or fail an exam. That is a really toxic attitude. It makes a bad situation worse. The person cannot see a setback as an opportunity to become better or take a break to clear their mind, but as a final word on their identity and fate.

It's borderline psychotic what our society considers acceptable behaviour to a person going through a difficult time. All sound like probable valid reasons, but are signs of an unhealthy society. I was about to write a long write up going into detail here, but I lost interest.   [deleted] Hard? Yes. But totally justified. We Indians are inherently assholes. I have seen several people just sit on their ass all day and do nothing after they reach a certain position because they start believing that no one can touch them. Every year they get a small increment and every few years a promotion. We need to stop this culture and show them that it's not gonna work. All well OP?  You can always lie. It is difficult to verify if you are an employee of an IT company. Stupid points , 1,2 and 3 are essentially same.
Social stigme covers relatives. And 4 is just patently wrong. In India people are less leveraged than already USA..
 
 anyone know where I can actually meet some of these people laid off? I'm a reporter. Is there like a park or some place a bunch of recently laid off people hang out? What do they do in their free time? sorry if its a dumb question ... lol. Contact Indian farmers..the'll show how it's done.  ",1495363386.0,1,21,0,32,"""Top 5 reasons why layoff in India can be especially hard"" 

Do you agree? 

1. Social stigma: The middle-class in India attaches a lot of ‘status’ to what one does for a living. Among the first questions one gets asked during introductions include “where do you work?” (or “Where does your husband work?”). “He used to work for Infosys and just got laid-off” doesn’t cut it.  

2. Identity and self-worth: Typical middle-class kids are conditioned to work hard to succeed. When one is laid-off due to factors beyond one’s control (‘business reasons’) one begins to question one’s basic values. 

3. Pressure from relatives: Those from an earlier generation – parents, uncles and relatives of IT workers – equate ‘layoff’ to ‘firing.’ Right after layoff, they may begin to gossip “Ramesh was fired by Wipro. I though he was doing well there. What did he do wrong?” 

4. Financial challenges : Many IT workers over-leveraged their finances by “Investing” in expensive, upscale apartments, houses, cars and white-goods with large EMIs and credit card payments. Sudden stoppage of a paycheck can certainly be hard. 

5. Other practical challenges:  Many of those who are being laid-off are single and in their twenties and early thirties. Until recently, an ‘IT groom’ with a nice paycheck was a prime-catch in the matrimonial market. All the news of doom-and-gloom in IT sector is perhaps making families with eligible brides and grooms re-think alliances from those in IT sector.

I’m going to go read it. Now one else has to waste their time on this shit. Literally /r/badeconomics. Thank you for your service to the nation. One of the worst economic survey's ever in the recent years. It was expected, given how the current CEA got his job,

Why demonetisation will be revolutionary in India’s fight against corruption"", and ""Demonetisation: Are the poor really suffering?"", respectively, Subramanian supported the Government of India's banknote demonetisation policy in 2016. What didn't catch your eye

1. Nudge economics and excessive stress on behavioural economics -> it seems like a kind of foreshadowing and a prelude to ""excuses for data theft""

2. After speaking few pages on gibberish on big data and data, the govt reiterates the same lines as it did before aadhar judgment. Sovereignty of data, state security and providing cheap data to corporates while again, using the garb of security and ease of biz

3. All the wanking on beti bachao beti padhao being an immense success and swacchh bharat being a great success. Sorry to let you know, the chapters seemed kind of promotion than anything related to policy prescription. That's quite a downgrade, even under NDAs standards, given I haven't missed an ES since 2014

4. For all the bashing of anglo saxon economics. Do yourself a favor. Pick up es 2018, book 1. See chapter 1 or chapter 2 (basically the big chapter). In one of the boxes, where it compares to USA and then later in another of the chapters, where it compares savings and investment slowdowns across economies, it shamelessly uses Rodriks theory and proves, India shouldn't give a Damn about savings rate. This time it did a 180. 😂 Bro thank you for the effort You missed out The Nudge. The mass control program. They are gonna make robots out of people. For the first time ever, a government has openly admitted to using behavioral control. Just imagine the consequences of it as used in electoral politics. Thank you! Can you please ELI5 general equilibrium theory? I am little concern about mutual alienation between india and russia and in return US's backstabbing. 

Theoretically US-China's trade war should benefit india, but by the way US has treated us in the previous term i am not sure. High quality stuff.. thanks! [deleted] So is this a major policy break then? Is India ditching free market economics for some sort of a social democracy (e.g., like the Nordic Model) or are we adapting the managed-economy model of China? Could someone explain exactly what Nudges the govt is implementing?

I've read the book called Nudge by Thaler. It could be a good thing if done right or it could be Orwellian if done wrong. ",1562264945.0,1,46,0,94,"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory.

720,Policy/Economy,">Acharya has been uncomfortable ever since the exit of Urjit Patel as Governor of RBI. His academic views of the financial system was in contrast with the rest of the system. 

Bichde sabhi baari baari... BC hope there's no announcement coming that he wants to disown. This was bound to happen. Oh this is bad. Very very bad.

Deputy governor is a very important member of the Monetary Policy Committee ( one that decides policy stance and repo rates, basically major macroeconomic decisions ). This 5 member panel has government nominees too and decisions are taken by majority vote. 

Since the decisions are taken by a majority vote, it is always advisable to have majority economists so that RBI policies are not driven by political agendas but only sound economics.

And he was one of the few economists in the panel that constitute the MPC, especially after they replaced an economist with a Bureaucrat as the governor RBI.

So why would he quit? Essentially because there's no point for him to be there as virtual liquidation of RBI as an institution has lead to loss of value of individual opinion. In an organisation dominated by bureaucrats, decisions are now not taken in Mumbai ( RBI HQ ) but in Delhi. 

Terrible news. The off balance sheet borrowing pegs the fiscal deficit at 8-9% of the GDP.

Let's stop this silly comparison to China. The beat us badly in the last 1-2 decades, and we are not going to catch up with them now. I am not sure how many commenting have actually read the article,  headline is misleading and does not tell what is the comparison,  bloomberg talks of defense budget mainly, in what sense can india compete with china's defense budget, china is a much bigger economy and have more spending power and is not comparable to india Because economic growth is exponential. The increase in the size of the economy depends on the current size of the economy. China's economy is already 5 times ours. Military spending and geo-political influence which the article is talking about depend on the current size of the economy. It is mathematically impossible for India to 'catch up' with China unless China's economic growth slips to around 2%. Has more to do with China performing exceptionally well than India underperforming.

India is the fastest growing major economy right now but will never reach the crazy per year growth China has had.

722,Policy/Economy,"An undivided India would've been a disaster which would have made Indians pine for the rule of the British. The compromises that the Congress and the Muslim league would have had to make to avoid partition would've led to an extremely weak centre and immensely strong regional provinces, this would've quickly led to the creation of communal blocs in India with the Muslim provinces of Kashmir, sind, eastern Bengal, Punjab (barely Muslim majority though),NWFP facing off against the Hindu provinces elsewhere.

There would have been competitive communalism to an extent that you can't even imagine. The Muslim league during British times often petitioned them to declare Sind and NWFP as new provinces because they desired numerical parity with the Hindu dominated provinces of present day India like Bombay, Madras, UP etc. This was because they wanted to engage in a balance of power type of situation where if a UP state passes a law banning say, cow slaughter then NWFP will pass a law banning public celebration of Diwali. This communalist tit for tat would've only strengthened communal forces and led quickly to a civil war situation only in this case the violence wouldn't have been confined to the border provinces of Punjab and Bengal but would've engulfed the whole territory of the sub continent. There would be riots in Sindh and in retaliation there would be riots in Kerala. 

In foreign policy terms India would have a restive Muslim population in Pakistan which would look for third party support from fellow Muslim nations of Iran and Afghanistan. This would be especially potent because there are vast historical and cultural links between the border territories with Pashtuns in the case of Pakistan and Balochis in the case of Iran, crudely the Indus river actually is the real dividing line between Indian people and iranic people. The Indian state would have similarly onerous defence requirements as it does now with the Pakistani border except it would also have to deal with a local population whose loyalty would always be suspect. Pakistan has tried to pre empt Pashtun nationalism by raising up the Taliban to supplant it with Islamic radicalisation, an option not available to a Non Islamic Indian state. 

India would also be much more vulnerable to the mess in Central Asia and the middle East, both of the cold war (like Iran and Afghanistan) as well as the recent rise of Isis type Islamic extremism. This has nearly destroyed the Pakistani state but the borders between the two countries has shielded India from the worst of it. The Punjabi Muslim (according to Ambedkar) was always the most susceptible to ideas of Muslim brotherhood with the ability of radicals to weaponise this (like with the Mujahideen). If these people were in the Indian state then it is more than plausible that they would still be as radicalized as they are now, except now as citizens of India they would have free reign to carry out attacks throughout the country instead of being largely confined to Pakistan. 

In terms of economy, Ambedkar in his thoughts on partition showcased that the provinces of present day Pakistan were mostly a drag on the British exchequer while the Indian provinces were a tax surplus. This isn't necessarily true for all times but if you factor in the communal hatred that would develop between Hindu provinces and Muslim provinces then I struggle to see a situation where the economic gains would be great. Harmony is usually better for the economy than conflict.

The situation of minorities of all types would've been worse. Indian non muslims don't really care about the situation of their co religionists in Pakistan or Bangladesh. This is pretty much true for Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims as well with one huge exception being the Babri masjid demolition which kicked off riots in Bangladesh and Pakistan aimed at Hindus there, destroying temples and killing people etc. This wouldn't be the case in an undivided India, Hindu minorities in Muslim provinces would be hostages ensuring the safety and well being of Muslim minorities in Hindu provinces. This was an idea mooted solely by the Muslim league but I'm pretty sure that once there had been a tit for tat riot then the Hindu communalists wouldn't be far behind in adopting this theory. Needless to say, not a good way to run a country.

People often say that India is secular only because it is 80% Hindu and I agree with that statement not because of any great rationality in the Hindu faith, but because the question of religious hegemony in India is settled. The proportion of muslim in undivided India would've been large enough for the Hindus to start feeling threatened and for the Muslims to start demanding their pound of flesh (and maybe a bit more). The insecurity is highest at such a point where there's a chance of hegemonic change, it could've been a domestic variant of Thucydides Trap leading to civil war and eventual fragmentation of the country. Far better for one religious group to be in the outright, unchallengeable majority and to feel secure enough by this to give rights to the minority religions.

As far as i remember, he wasnt given an extension.

Last quarter banks recovered almost 9Billion dollars which is the highest ever.  ",1545531001.0,1,57,0,96,"**Who appointed Urjit Patel?**

Narendra Modi.

**Why did Raghu Ram Rajan step down?**

Because Narendra Modi and his government would not act against NPA companies. And also because draconian Demonetization was being planned.


**Why did Deputy RBI Governor Viral Acharya raise the issue of Section 7 of RBI Act and warn the Government?**

Because Government wanted to step in and take over the Reserves of 10,00,000+ Crores lying with RBI and use them to plug NPA's.


**Why does the Government want all this money?**

Because banks have been rendered empty and the 4,00,000 Crore windfall gain from Demonetization never happened.


**Why companies are declaring NPA's?**

Because their business have failed due to a failing and failing economy.


**But is the economy not doing very well under Narendra Modi?**

If that was the case, there was no need to take over RBI Reserves. The story about the economy doing well is a fake story like everything else told to you by Narendra Modi.


**What triggered this take over bid of RBI Reserves?**

Because many companies were declaring NPA's and the biggest shock came when IL&FS declared (officially) an NPA of 90,000 Crores. And none of the directors was arrested.


**But why take over RBI Reserves when it had already paid a dividend of 58,000 Crores for the last fiscal?**

Because that was not enough to fill the holes created by businessmen who lost money hand over fist.


**What will be the consequences for ordinary people when government prints more money?**

Prices will rise across the board as more money will be chasing the same basket of goods and services.



**Why Does Government of India require so much money and needs to print more?**

It is because GST has failed. From the expected collection of 1,30,000 Crores per month, it is only collecting 90,000 to 1,00,000 Crores with 30,000 Crores going back as refunds. Every month there has been a deficit of 30,000 Crores on an average.



**Why GST Collection has fallen?**

Because it has been declared by IMF as the most complex form of taxation in the world and Indian businessmen have been smart to find out ways to avoid it, also the business volume has fallen as economy has failed.



**Why Business Volume has fallen?**

If you withdraw 83% of blood of an economy for 2 months and then take 6 months to pump back that blood, you can't expect the person to get up and start running as if nothing had happened. Demonetization was such a blunder. It killed the economy and India lost 2% of GDP, which is approximately 3,00,000 Crores. And the losses continue. But Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar have both certified Demonetization as a brilliant move and they have also been endorsed by the likes of Aishwarya Rai and Paresh Rawal.



**What is the immediate danger?**

Telecom sector, that has seen mergers is now three players, Airtel, Vodafone Idea Limited and Jio and all three are bleeding. Telecom sector is sitting on 8,00,000 Crore possible NPA as estimated by SBI internal report which was later suppressed.


**What about the GDP figures that show NDA-2 doing better than UPA-2?**

Former CEA has already spoken on this and informed how the Niti Aayog changed the figures and how to make NDA-2 look better they made UPA-2 look bad. They just drew a bigger line next to the UPA-2 Line.



**Who is responsible for all this mess?**
Of course Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru is responsible for all this mess and his family. They have not allowed Narendra Modi to do anything in the last 56 months. Had Sardar Patel been the First PM, none of this might have happened.

**Who should resign?**

That's a stupid question!!! Of Course Sonia Gandhi should resign and Rahul Gandhi should resign as Congress President and Modi should be given a free hand with the 10,00,000 Crore RBI Reserves to do what he wants to do.


**Who should you vote for in 2019?**

Of course Narendra Modi, because he is the 11th Incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He is the savior of Hindus. He is the only person on the face of earth who can teach Muslims a lesson. He is the only person in India who can protect the cow. He is the only person in India who takes 'care' of the poor, marginal, soldiers and veterans. He is the only person in India who can build the Ram Mandir. He is the only person on earth who has left behind his wife and family and even his mother and the only person who himself lives on 10 acres of prime property, protected by 5 layers of security while his 90+ year old mother stands in bank queues to withdraw 4000 Rupees as per demonetization rules along with a camera crew. Because he is the only PM who has traveled the world and done so many town-hall and rock-star type shows. Because he does Mann-Ki-Baat every month on Radio and it is broadcast on TV too. He is the only person who can buy 36 jets instead of 126 jets by paying the same price and convince you without giving you any data that 36 > 126 and he has in fact saved money for the nation and yet managed to give 30,000 Crores to friend Anil Ambani.

Because there is no other person in the whole country who is more qualified than him with his MA in 'Entire Political Science' and a missing BA.

730,Policy/Economy,"> The Twitter hashtag #DrSinghGDPKing 

Cool. > The Modi government has once again got a panic attack. The Twitter hashtag #DrSinghGDPKing caused it. The underlying reason behind the alarming palpitations is a research panel of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation releasing a back-series adjusted GDP based on 2011-12 prices to make GDP comparisons dispassionate shorn of political googlies. This would enable holistic policy-making besides providing fodder for rigorous academic reasoning. **The Bharatiya Janata Party’s acute nervousness was on account of two manifestations of the sub-committee’s findings:**

> - 1) As expected, UPA-1 ( 2004-09) had a record-breaking five-year average GDP growth of 8.87%, an unprecedented score in India’s history.

> - 2) Even the much-maligned, badgered UPA-2 had a more impressive lead over the headline-grabbing hyperbolic NDA, 7.39% as against 7.2%.

> **Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote a hurried, poorly researched rhetorical blog**, Niti Aayog chief put out a few dubious tweets as a diversionary tactic ...

> ... Jaitley & co made an embarrassingly phlegmatic attempt to puncture UPA-1’s triumphant performance. **According to them, Dr Manmohan Singh inherited a booming 8.1% GDP growth from the Vajpayee government** in 2003-04 and just rode a providential bonanza thereafter ... **What he artfully dodges is that in the preceding year of 2001-02, the GDP had touched a nadir of 3.7% , even lower than the 3.9% of 2000-01** ... **Truth be said, NDA-1 just about averaged 5.6%**, and was easily outclassed by the formidable Dr Singh-P Chidambaram-Montek Singh Ahluwalia triumvirate.

> ... Jaitley then caustically refers to fiscal profligacy of average 5% of GDP under UPA, while selectively ignoring that under NDA-1 fiscal deficit was higher at 5.5% . That is called cherry-picking. **Under NDA-1 the average crude oil price was around $30 per barrel, while under UPA that skyrocketed to over $145 at one stage**; Jaitley has a memory loss of this stupendous escalation when discussing the inflationary impact. Yet, one of the most extraordinary accomplishments in human history happened during UPA; **poverty declined by over two-and-a-half times than under NDA and 140 million people were lifted out of poverty, the second largest ever after China.** Naturally, Jaitley did not mention this crucial statistic in India’s celebrated growth story under Dr Singh. A pity, really.

> ... **agriculture under UPA grew at an annualised 3.6%, while it was 2.2% under NDA-1.** Private consumption went up 40% faster under the UPA as did private disposable income at 20% as compared to NDA’s 8.3%. At core, **both the rural farmers and urban dwellers were better off under Dr Singh.** ...

> Jaitley is being mendacious with facts when he talks of alleged scams ... The tradition has continued in NDA-2 with Nirav Modi, Mehul Bhai Choksi and some other close buddies of the current dispensation ...

> ... **UPA-2 (7.39) has outperformed NDA-2 (7.2%) as well by a convincing margin** despite overwhelming headwinds; I list four of them.

> **First, UPA-2 faced the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2007/8** which literally incinerated economies worldwide. It’s ramifications were both geographically spread (the Eurozone crisis) as well as structurally penetrative. It was the world’s most testing survival period after the Great Depression of the 1930s.

> **Secondly, oil prices reached a dizzying average of over $110 a barrel**, creating a massive pressure on current account deficit and fiscal deficit, and adding to an inflationary spiral. 

> **Third, UPA had a coalition government** and thus required circumspect calibration in policy-making which was done with adroit political maturity through consensus building. 

> **Fourth, it was actually parliamentary paralysis** (which Jaitley famously described as legitimate political strategy) forced by a belligerent BJP that created a gridlock and prevented the GST and several legislation from becoming a reality during UPA’s tenure.

> **Yet, UPA-2 has done better than NDA-2, who have had the tailwind of oil prices at $28 at one stage, low inflation, a majority government, growing world economy and above all, a strong inheritance of a robust recovering economy from the UPA-2 of 6.4%. Incidentally, UPA crossed double-digit growth rates twice during its 10-year period.** GONNA VOTE FOR CONGRESS. he is also King of Inflation.

**India Retains Position As Fastest Growing Economy, GDP Growth Accelerates To 7.7% In Q4** 

 ______ 
India retained its position as the world's fastest growing major economy in
the January-March quarter, well ahead of China. India's

GDP or gross domestic product

growth accelerated to 7.7 per cent in the March quarter - the fastest pace of
growth in seven quarters. Strong growth in agriculture (4.5 per cent),
manufacturing (9.1 per cent) and construction sectors (11.5 per cent)
contributed to the overall growth. Growth for Asia's third-largest economy,
reported by the Ministry of Statistics, trumped forecasts in a Reuters poll
for annual growth of 7.3 per cent. GDP had grown at a revised 7 per cent in
October-December quarter.

For the full year (2017-18), GDP expanded at 6.7 per cent, lower than the 7.1
per cent recorded in the previous year.

Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank, said: ""Today's GDP number is very
comforting and should put a lot of concerns to rest. It seems like we have
moved beyond the teething troubles related to GST implementation. The pick-up
in investment activity (fixed capital formation) is also a good sign.""  
  
The faster pace of growth in the latest quarter might also strengthen
expectations for a rate hike by the RBI later this year. ""We expect RBI to
revise its policy stance in June and follow it up with a hike of 25 bps in
August policy,"" said Garima Kapoor, economist and vice president at Elara
Capital.  

Many economists expect India's economy to grow more than 7 per cent in
2018-19, helped by a normal monsoon and a pickup in private investment.

Though global rating agency

Moody's earlier this week

cut its GDP growth forecast for India due to higher oil prices and tighter
financial conditions, it still expects the country's GDP to expand by 7.3 per
cent this fiscal year.

GDP growth in 2018-19 could get a boost from prospects of good monsoon,
potentially brightening the outlook for agricultural output.

Economists also point out to many risk factors that could put downward
pressure on GDP growth. Possibly, the biggest risk could be rising crude oil
prices, which this month hit $80 a barrel, their highest since 2014. India
meets 80 per cent of its oil needs from imports.

Domestic

prices of petrol and diesel

are near all-time highs, putting pressure on the government to bring down
taxes on the fuels.

Rising oil prices could also weigh on the consumer demand, say economists. The
government's Economic Survey, issued in January, estimated that every $10 per
barrel rise in global oil prices cuts growth by 0.2-0.3 percentage points.

Higher crude oil prices have already hurt the rupee, which slumped to near a
record low this month. It is down about 6 per cent so far this year against
the US dollar.

__ Comments

Banking credit, a main source for corporate borrowing, has remained weak
following a surge in bad loans, as banks have been reluctant to extend new
loans. The 21 state lenders hold two-thirds of banking assets, and accounted
for the bulk of the record $150 billion of soured loans in the banking sector
in 2017.

Separately, infrastructure sector recorded a 4.7 per cent growth in April, as
against 2.6 per cent a year ago, data released by government showed.

Here is a brief list to answer your question Mister Prime Minister:

1. For destroying India's economy via Demonetisation and not taking responsibility for the damage it has done.

2. For destroying the traditional plural culture of our ancient land via organised polarisation - not just religious, but also regional, linguistic and cultural.

3. For destroying the profound teachings of Hinduism/ Sanatan Dharma by placing Savarkar's fascist Hindutva as Hinduism.

4. For continuing the charade of fake nationalism when your deeds and policies are only harming India.

5. For being a government - not of India - but of Hindutva forces, crony corporations and foreign vested interests - especially the Zionist global banking cartel.

6. For false promises and falsehoods which are being spread through multiple channels everyday.

7. For violating the principles of the Indian Constitution by introducing theocratic militant nationalism and anti-privacy/ anti-freedom Aadhaar.

8. For destroying the pillars of Democracy by de-fanging media and institutions - which are critical to offer any semblance of truth and justice.

9. For not listening to people and the diversity of voices - but to impose dictates via coercion and intimidation.

10. For being anti-intellectual and actively promoting the hatred of the learned and the educated.

11. For doing all the tricks in the book to curb dissent and freedom of expression.

12. For sinking all the human development indexes since 2014.

13. For waging a fake 'morality play 'of anti-corruption crusade when the real policies of the government point to the opposite direction.

14. For hiding from unscripted questions which the people want to ask you - no single press conference since you came to power.

15. For focussing on PR, publicity, events and propaganda, but not the real issues of the nation.

16. For ruining India's traditional 'non-aligned' foreign policy.

17. For instigating the ego - hate and greed - through your theatrical 'carrot and stick' speeches.

18. For surrounding yourself with sycophants who have no talent for governance.

19. For being obsessive about grandiose ideas/ misplaced priorities and failing to deliver.

20. For misunderstanding the meaning of 'development' by neglecting social justice.

21. For being pro-super-rich and putting the poor and the Middle class under the technocratic Neoliberal Economic policies which have hollowed out the West.

22. For raging a war against India via the toxic brew of Hindutva and Neoliberalism, and destroying the people's faith and trust upon the government.

They voted for development and didn't expect such a dick move from him. We young generation from UP is really fed up with caste and religion politics. We want development and jobs. But what we got?

First one. Is this true? Last numbers I heard is that Indias growth is over 6% and [is expected to continue](http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2015/01/14/india-china-gdp-growth-world-bank.jpg). Also, Chinas lead is decreasing. 

If this is economy ""destroyed"" what word is he using when growth is negative? 

Im not being facetious. Im genuinely wondering if economy is now destroyed. What are his indicators that this is the case. Seriously NAM ? Are living in sixties ? We Signed a defense cooperation treaty in 1960s which saved our ass against American nuclear missiles.

And had Israeli technology helping our army during Kargil.

The Nam countries didnt give a fuck when China attacked us in 1962.

Modi is just following what Congress was doing in 10 years who themselves were continuing the good work of Previous governments.

Criticizing the govt for it is just clueless. modi is much better than congrees if not the best.atleast he is doing something for the nation and taking risks unlike congress.

- Increasing income inequality.

- Enriching babaji's who masquerade as spiritual gurus. Providing them army to build bridges for private events and suppressing activists who protest against environmental destruction for other babaji's from the south.

- Taking advice on demonotisation from a babaji who on behalf of a quack think tank reccomended demonitisation to Mudi.

- Completley bending foreign policy to the west and not adhering to decades of non aligned status. 

- Almost selling off and destroying India's generics industry in the first 6 months of power which would have made basic drugs cost an arm and a leg to attract 'fdi' only to see a backlash.

- Completely disintegrating out military industrial complex that was on the verge of next gen technology only to buy equipment from foreign companies with zero transfer of technology so foreigners and crony capitalists can profit

- Paying zero attention to the agriculture sector which has been completely destroyed.

- Paying no attention no attention to SME sector which is dying without credit while behaving like an NRI prime minister and begging foreign firms to make in India

- Throwing Rajan out to help his crony capitalist friends; i.e so they don't have to pay back their loans

- Spending billions on novelty projects like trains while making no investments in healthcare.

- reducing healthcare spending to try turn India's healthcare into US healthcare shitty and expensive

- MP's like Mahesh Giri who were formerly with babaji's who support Modi using violence against JNU and beating women reporters and calling them anti national.

- Generally using violence as a state policy and killing judges, reporters and activists.

- Trying to destroy the judiciary and making the last institution of India the SC which is honest into a dalali organisation

- making absolutely zero economic reforms to help the common man.

- furthering Hindutva/cow politics  not Hinduism/Sanatan Dharam and sponsoring state violence against dalits.

- Opening up INdia's economy like the real estate sector and retail to foreign speculators while asking for nothing in return i.e visas or job permit increases. Which then bail out builders and destroy the economy.

- Lying about building electricity access and infrastructure at a faster pace.

- Looting money from the public through various cess's like Swach Bharat etc.

**Don’t evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST, says PM Modi** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday urged the nation to not judge him only
on the basis of his decisions to implement demonetisation and GST. “Don’t
evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST, we brought economic reform, built
toilets, brought electricity to 18000 villages,” PM Modi said in an exclusive
interview with Zee News.

Talking about his global approach, the Prime Minister who recently hosted his
Israeli counterpart in New Delhi and Gujarat said, “They said my understanding
was limited to Gujarat. I made it my strength. I did not follow protocol, I
was a simple man with no baggage. I made friends the world over.”

On the upcoming World Economic Forum, Modi said that the world wants to hear
“directly from the Horse’s mouth.” The PM also talked about India’s policies
and growth potential and expressed that he felt proud to represent India in
Davos.

Stating that the Indian economy is growing at a rapid pace, PM Modi said the
Davos meet is a “good opportunity” for the country as it is a big market with
the strength of demographic dividend. “The country is seeing the biggest jump
in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). It is natural that the world wants to talk
directly to India and the world wants to hear directly from the horse’s mouth
about India’s policies and potential. It matters if you hear it from the
leader,” he added.

Meanwhile, Modi also stressed on his push for conducting simultaneous polls
for Lok Sabha and state assemblies and said that like festivals it should be
held on fixed schedule.

**Modi may be the last hope for the Indian economy to achieve greatness** 

 ______ 
Recent weeks have witnessed an enormous amount of hand-wringing in the press
about India’s economy. These articles share a common thematic trajectory: they
start with a recitation of statistics that highlight a slowdown, lay it on the
doorsteps of demonetisation and GST, and in the grand tradition of the blood-
sport which is Indian politics, either use these statistics to settle personal
scores, or, as in the case of the political opposition, use it to prepare
oneself for 2019 with nervous glee. None of this hand-wringing is accompanied
with any insight or solutions beyond the obvious.

The fox knows many things. The hedgehog knows one important thing.

In a now famous essay written when he was an Oxford Don in the 1930’s, Isaiah
Berlin classified people into foxes and hedgehogs as a means of making a
distinction about people and the different ways in which they confront
reality. Foxes, according to Berlin, may know many things, but a coherent
worldview is beyond their comprehension. The hedgehog, however, knows one
great truth, and steadfast in its pursuit, remains unreconciled until he/she
reaches it.

This parable is perhaps the best way to understand Narendra Modi and his
actions surrounding the economy. Modi is the hedgehog who knows what India
needs to do to become prosperous, but importantly, is also willing to act upon
it. Indeed, he may be the only politician in contemporary Indian history who
has undertaken structural reforms out of choice rather than, like Narasimha
Rao in the 1990’s, being compelled to do so.

Structural reform is thankless: costs are borne upfront, and rewards come
later. (The currency for this transaction is political capital, and Arun
Jaitley has paid the most for his role as the able knight who is the face of
such change.) For years, it was the very absence of these structural reforms
that armchair foxes have bemoaned. Now that the reforms are occurring, the
foxes are coming out of the forest, and unwilling to pay the price, claim that
these are ill-timed, ill-conceived or ill-executed.

Through his decade-long executive leadership of one of India’s richest states,
Modi knows what the foxes don’t: First, that there’s never a right time to
make a hard choice, and second, the slowdown is the result of a fundamental
fragility of the Indian economy baked into India’s economic foundation at its
creation: the government’s overwhelming role in the economy.

Modi is seeking to eliminate this fragility by recalibrating the entire engine
of India’s economic growth methodically: Jaitley’s increasing of the states’
share in the divisible pool of union taxes in 2015,
digitisation/demonetisation of the economy in 2016, the GST in 2017, Piyush
Goyal’s work in the power sector over the last three years, Nitin Gadkari’s
ongoing work in transportation, all are transformative and quantifiable
contributors to the structure of the economy, and designed to create a robust
and higher equilibrium for the Indian economy from which it can propel itself
higher.

That these reforms are happening without any taint on any senior politician of
the government is in itself a first in India’s modern history. The republic
was lucky to survive through years of pillage under the Congress, and if it
were nothing else but just that the BJP is taint-free, we would still have
much to be thankful for.

But Modi’s toughest test is yet to come. Just as Modi fought the culture wars
and reshaped our national discourse on identity and nationhood for all time,
and just as how he is transforming India’s foreign policy through a new Modi-
doctrine, he must now dismantle the greatest vestige of Jawaharlal Nehru’s and
Indira Gandhi’s legacy: the socialist superstructure that is the curse of
India. Only when he is finished, will he have succeeded in his undeclared
personal ambition: to bury Nehru and Indira Gandhi forever.

To do so involves treating the economic organisation of a society not merely
in transactional terms, but as a moral issue inextricably linked to individual
rights and dignity, and moving wholeheartedly towards the only economic system
that provides for such: a free-market system adapted to help those on India’s
economic margins.

In doing so, he would do well to reduce his reliance on ever wiser economic
councils and bureaucrats, but follow his hedgehog instincts which have yielded
such sharp results in foreign policy and India’s culture wars. (As an aside, I
note with some amusement a lesson from my first class in economics with
Professor Jagdish Bhagwati: “India did so badly in the 50’s and 60’s not
because it had too few economists, but because it had too many!”)

This then, is the call to arms. In addition to a dogged focus on anti-
corruption (a necessary issue for 2014 but insufficiently ambitious for 2019),
Modi needs to speak to the country in civilisational terms about the manner of
its economic organisation, and seek the mandate to put the nation on the path
to double-digit growth for decades to come.

In practical terms, and as a first step, it requires the sale of the
government-owned banks and PSU’s in their entirety. Not re-capitalisation, not
mere NPA-resolution, not partial-disinvestment of loss-making PSU’s etc. A
complete sale. These are giant black holes that destroy capital, or at best,
use it sub-optimally. Modi cannot rebuild a nation without removing the
termites from its foundation.

By seizing the time still available in 2017-2019 (and perhaps for five years
thereafter), Modi may still live up to his own revolutionary declaration of
2014: “Government has no role in business”. Modi may represent the last best
hope for the Indian economy to achieve true greatness. If Modi doesn’t do it
now, India will be condemned to this middling, snakes-and-ladder growth
pattern for another several generations.

If not Modi, then who? If not now, then when?

The hedgehog knows.

 ______ 
If economic policies are managed well India will be a powerhouse economy, IMF
has said

**Washington: **

India can become a powerhouse economy if policies are managed well and reforms
are supportive of inclusive growth, a top IMF official has said.

David Lipton, the International Monetary Fund's First Deputy Managing
Director, also expressed hope that India's growth will be reflected in poverty
reduction statistics and eventually in a measurement of metrics of inclusion.

""If policies are managed well and reforms are supportive of inclusive growth,
India's economy could become a powerhouse economy. It is already, I think the
10th largest, but with the population and the growth rate there's more
potential,"" he told news agency PTI.

""I've said there's more to be done. There are further reforms both in terms of
consolidating the budget situation to ensure that there's never an incident of
doubt about fiscal finances in terms of making the banking system more
competitive and dealing with the legacy problems of NPAs (non- performing
assets),"" he said.

He said the important job was not just to recapitalise, but to change the
governance and change the competitiveness so that banks serve as a positive
force by allocating credit well and being a driving force in the economy .

__ Comments

Asked about IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde's remarks that she does
not expect any major economic reforms in an election year, Mr Lipton said:
""It's always a difficult to make policy during election years.

""We certainly hope that there can continue to be a progress, but it's really
the judgement of the politicians, the government about what can be done when"".

**It’s time Modi government stopped blaming RBI** 

 ______ 
Overall, the Narendra government has muddled through, producing a middling policy record and a middling growth record. Photo: PTI

Before the six-member committee that sets monetary policy for the Reserve Bank of India met this week, the government in New Delhi made its preferences very clear. Two members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic advisory council—a body that he did without for a long time, but which was recently reconstituted following several policy stumbles—publicly declared that real interest rates were too high. But the RBI committee held firm and kept India’s policy interest rate at six percent.

This could have been, and was, predicted. India’s central bank is now officially supposed to be targeting consumer price inflation and nothing else; the government agreed to this change over a year ago. And inflation has been inching up, driven by higher prices for food and fuel. In October, consumer price inflation was the highest in seven months.

Formal requirements apart, of course, it would’ve been hard for the central bank to ignore the government’s pleas if the economy were stalled. But the government achieved something of a victory last week when GDP growth in the second quarter of 2017 came in at 6.3%, slightly faster than in the first quarter. That eliminated pressure on the RBI to cut rates and stimulate investment. Instead, the central bank’s priority is guarding against the possibility that higher growth will begin to affect wages—and, in particular, real estate prices, which the RBI singled out for attention in its policy statement.

This illustrates the government’s great dilemma. Growth in India never quite slows down enough to make crisis measures necessary. Yet it never quite speeds up enough to satisfy the aspirations of Modi, his party and his voters (not to mention his critics). The couple things the government has gotten right in the past few months—its attempts to streamline the new goods-and-services tax and its determined approach to cleaning up distressed assets—haven’t been dramatic enough either to ease the RBI’s worries or to push the economy to a permanently higher growth path.

Overall, this government has muddled through, producing a middling policy record and a middling growth record. Now it’s clear that the RBI won’t bail it out; the best chance for lower rates may have passed. Any revival of private investment—which, as a proportion of GDP, was even lower in the second quarter than the first—will have to come from somewhere else.

Frankly, if the government is serious about a growth revival, it will have to return to the drawing board. It still has time and political capital to spare before it has to face the voters in 2019. There is an entire set of reforms that it hasn’t touched since its first few months in power: to India’s problematic labour markets, for example, or to the ways available to industry and developers to acquire agricultural land.

Recently, India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, insisted that India would become a $10-trillion dollar economy by 2030. That would mean moving toward double-digit growth in dollar terms very soon. Yet there’s no indication of that on the horizon. Frankly, the signs to me aren’t propitious. While the growth slowdown may have reversed, part of that was simply a dead-cat bounce. Manufacturers who had stopped production to de-stock before the introduction of the new GST started up again in the second quarter. That’s hardly sustainable.

Nor is the government capable of intervening itself to prop up growth. In fact, it’s running out of money to keep stimulating the economy: It has already run through most of its fiscal deficit cushion for the year, and the RBI flagged the fiscal stresses caused by higher pay for government employees and Indian states’ mad competition to forgive agricultural debt. Nor are there really any signs, even anecdotally, of renewed investment in India’s private sector.

It’s hard to see 6.3% growth as a major achievement in India. As the RBI pointed out, it’s not a disaster. But, if the government is honest with itself, it’s not a triumph either. It’s time that Modi, his ministers and his advisers turned to the many reforms they’ve left pending—and stopped blaming the RBI. Bloomberg View

 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. 

Manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.

As far as UK is concerned, what period was the capacity weak & when did it become strong? I don't think India has an  unemployment problem It just has people who don't want to work.

It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

 ______ 
**Opinion: Modi's Approach To China Has Done Us Proud** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government's decision to not send an envoy to China's big
Belt and Road Forum (abbreviated, incredibly, BARF) has been the cause of much
wailing and gnashing of teeth in New Delhi. Given the fact that India is
practically the only large economy to not be represented there - and that
dozens and dozens of countries have sent representatives, many the heads of
their governments - it has come across to some people as the Modi government
deliberately choosing to isolate India. It has been criticised thus as
stubborn opposition to an initiative that has seized the world's imagination.

Well, if Modi has isolated India on this issue, so be it. He and his foreign
policy establishment deserve praise for taking a bold stand of dissent on
grounds that are both principled and realist.

The government's thinking on this issue is unusually clear and well-
articulated. The Ministry of External Affairs released a statement that
""connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility
to avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden for communities;
balanced ecological and environmental protection and preservation standards;
transparent assessment of project costs; and skill and technology transfer to
help long term running and maintenance of the assets created by local
communities."" It is worth noting that India's legitimate objections to the
path of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC - one of the sub-
initiatives of One Belt One Road or OBOR - also got a mention, but were
clearly rhetorically subordinate to the larger, principled objection about the
sustainability issues involved.

While India is the only large economy to not send a representative to BARF, it
is not as if it has received universal acclaim among those who have gone. The
Guardian reported that the European Union has abstained from some of the
resolutions the Chinese expected them to sign up to, citing environmental
reasons. Nor has the United States sent a senior official. So even the talk of
""isolation"" is not entirely true. Not every large country is willing to sign
up to Beijing's vision of a Middle Kingdom-centric global economy, but India
is the only major country willing to take a clear and visible stand on the
subject, and of that we can be proud.

Let's be clear: this does not mean that Indian companies may not take
advantage of OBOR connectivity, wherever it does get built. This is a free
country and a (relatively) free economy, and nobody will stop an Indian
manufacturer from using railway lines somewhere else in the world paid for by
China, if it helps their business. The private sector is not the government.
It is for the government, however, to take the long strategic view on what
OBOR connectivity will mean for the world, our neighbourhood, and our own
position in the global economy - and they have correctly decided that it will
not, on balance, be beneficial. Nor is this about distrusting China in
particular. India is more than willing to cooperate with China on
infrastructure finance - witness its decision to sign up to the AIIB and BRICS
Bank - and on the many issues being taken up in the BRICS and other forums.
This is, presumably, because it does not believe that those forums inherently
violate the principles that it believes OBOR, as currently structured, would
fail to uphold.

This is, frankly, the first time that I have felt that the Modi government has
taken a stand that the preceding government would have balked at doing. In
almost all cases, the Modi government foreign policy has been an extension of
Manmohan Singh's policies - which is entirely to its credit. Consistency in
such matters is the sign of a mature nation. But one of the errors that the
Singh government consistently made was to be extra-careful of Beijing's
sensitivities. It failed, in essence, to reap any reward for that attitude:
Beijing's foreign policy continued to be made with no thought of India's ""core
interests"". Consider, for example, climate change, where India signed up to
the Chinese agenda at the big conference of parties in Copenhagen during UPA-
II, only to find that Beijing went behind its back to sign a bilateral pact
with Washington on climate change a few years later. No doubt UPA-II would
also have learnt in time not to do so - but that does not take away any credit
from the Modi government for not being over-solicitous of Beijing's
sensitivities.

By taking the lead in questioning the basic rationale underlying OBOR, Modi
has done us proud. We should now ask, however: what next? A principled stand
on a conference is valuable in and of itself, but it needs to be followed up.

There are some obvious next moves. First, New Delhi must recognise that it is
essentially, by objecting to OBOR, standing up for liberal policies and
economics within various other countries. Thus India must now view itself as a
leader of a market-driven, liberal democratic bloc that wishes to create an
alternative view of the global economy to China's more authoritarian, state-
driven view. The latter is increasingly dominant, especially as Trump's
America turns its back on the world. We must stand up for market access, free
movement of capital goods and people, and liberal political principles
everywhere. This is both principled and in our real interests.

And second, we must work with the Japanese - our biggest partners in this
regard - to create connectivity belts that are not centred on China and which
serve our mutual strategic interests as well as not disrupting local countries
and economies the way OBOR might. Our cooperation with Japan - and Indonesia,
Singapore and Australia - must be taken to the next level.

Modi promised foreign policy leadership. For the first time, he is beginning
to deliver. He must keep going.

**Have to take temporary pain for long-term gain: VP Venkaiah Naidu on economy** 

 ______ 
Venkaiah Naidu said that there has to be a broader consensus as far as foreign and economic policies are concerned. (File photo) Venkaiah Naidu said that there has to be a broader consensus as far as foreign and economic policies are concerned. (File photo)

At a time when the Narendra Modi-led central government is battling a public perception of economic mismanagement, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu on Friday threw his weight behind the present dispensation and said the country has to face temporary pain for long-term gain.

“The temporary things… there will be some problem. Of course, you have to take temporary pain for long term gain. I am not getting into this arena. There are other people who are debating, using their skills, forgetting what they have done, what has to be done, what needs to be done,” Vice President Naidu said.

The Vice-President also stated that there has to be a broader consensus as far as foreign and economic policies are concerned.

Maintaining that even China is witnessing a slowdown in its economy, Naidu said that the global economy has slowed down and added that India remains a bright spot”in the midst of this”.

His reaction comes days after senior BJP leader and former finance minister Yashwant Sinha launched an attack on the government over handling of the economy. Sinha in his article in The Indian Express had blamed Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for the “mess” in the economy. He wrote that the economy is in a downward spiral, its revival unlikely by the 2019 elections and a “hard landing appears inevitable.

Later in the day, at a book launch event in New Delhi, Naidu talked on several issues. On terrorsim he said, “Terrorism has no religion, caste, creed.”

He further said, “Religion is used to mislead the younger generation, we should be wary of this. We should educate and enlighten people on evil effects of terrorism, how much it costs. Every country should speak in one voice. Political parties within the country also should speak with one voice, they shouldn’t try to score brownie political points.”

Naidu said, “Bullet can never bring change. If even if it brings change temporarily, it will not sustain. It is the ballot which is powerful than bullet in democracy, that has been proven. The society should discourage acts by people taking to arms and then trying to achieve there state political goal.”

**How can the Congress shed its 'Muslim party' image?** 

 ______ 
**_By Amulya Ganguli_**

Ever since the A.K. Antony committee identified the

Congress

's Muslim ""appeasement"" tag as a major reason for its electoral reverses, the
133-year-old Grand Old Party (GOP) has been unable to formulate a clear-cut
policy on the country's largest minority community.

In a transparent attempt to shed the derogatory label given by its opponents,
Congress President

Rahul Gandhi

has engaged in what has been called ""temple hopping"" and has even expressed a
desire to go on a pilgrimage to Kailash Manasarovar, the ultimate pilgrimage
destination in Tibet for Hindus.

The chances, however, of these gestures persuading Hindus to turn away in
droves from the avowedly pro-Hindu

Bharatiya Janata Party

(BJP) and support the Congress are minimal. Instead, the latter's new Hindu
card may confuse the Muslims.

Rahul's father,

Rajiv Gandhi

, also made the mistake of following a muddled policy when he opposed the
Supreme Court's judgement in favour of a divorced Muslim woman, Shah Bano, at
the behest of Muslim fundamentalists and then ordered the opening of the locks
of the Babri Masjid to please their Hindu counterparts.

However, the fact that religious overtures do not matter if the nation is seen
to be advancing economically was proven in 2009 when the Congress increased
its tally of Lok Sabha seats at a time when India was experiencing the
fastest-ever reduction of poverty, according to Arvind Subramanian, the former
Chief Economic Adviser of the

Narendra Modi

government.

Yet, only five years later, the Congress suffered its worst ever defeat
largely because of the ""socialistic"" policies favoured by Sonia Gandhi
advocated by the crypto-communist members of her National Advisory Council at
the expense of economic reforms.

What these ups and downs show is that economy is the key. There is no need
either to display an overt devotion to Hinduism or hold a meeting with a
select group of Muslim intellectuals, as Rahul Gandhi has done, to find out
what their community wants.

It is another matter that at the moment, the Muslims want a sense of security,
which was pointed out by former Vice President Hamid Ansari. Their angst is
understandable at a time when a Union minister garlands a group charged with
killing a Muslim.

But, in the long run, the most palpable sense of safety is provided by a
buoyant economy as it fosters a feeling of wellness which few want to disrupt
through targeted violence.

The BJP's success in 2014 was the outcome of Modi's appropriation of the
economic reforms which the Manmohan Singh government had neglected in its
twilight years when, as former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said, the
government made the mistake of taking its foot off the accelerator of reforms.

It is patent enough that the BJP would not have fared so well in 2014 if large
sections of the Muslims had not voted for it. If they are now feeling uneasy,
as Ansari has said, the reasons are not only the sporadic acts of violence of
the saffron activists, but also that the reforms have not delivered to the
extent they were expected to do.

As the original initiator of the reforms, the Congress's focus should be on
ways to rev up the economy and not on photo-ops at temples and powwows with
Muslim notables. If the party can generate enough confidence about its ability
to do what it alleges the Modi government has failed to do, there will be no
need for any kind of religious overtures.

Along with the articulation of development-oriented ideas, the Congress will
have to be less apologetic about its pursuit of secularism. While Jawaharlal
Nehru's Fabian socialism can be discarded when it doesn't exist even in the
fatherland of the creed, his

secularism

has to be preserved and nurtured.

If the Congress earned the reputation of being a ""Muslim party"", as Sonia
Gandhi has said, it is because of the misapplication of the secular principles
as the Shah Bano fiasco showed, for the doctrine does not entail pandering to
the Muslim hardliners as was done in the mid-1980s but to the ordinary members
of the community.

Their value is immense not because they constitute 14.2 per cent of the
population, numbering 172.2 million, second only to Indonesia (209 million)
and ahead of Pakistan (167.4 million), but because of their contributions to
India's art, architecture, cuisine and culture. Moreover, their interest lies
in advancing in step with the rest of the country as M.S. Sathyu's iconic
film, ""Garam Hawa"", depicted in the 1970s.

The Congress, however, made the mistake of seeing the community through the
lenses of the bigoted and bearded maulvis (clerics) and abiding by their
prejudices. Hence, the ""Muslim party"" nomenclature because the BJP was quick
to capitalise on the GOP's lapses in judgement.

It is time for the Congress to clarify that secularism does not stand for
appeasement of minorities but ensuring that they have a place of honour in the
country.

Their bhakti knows no bounds. /s this can not b digested by modi bashers A cashless economy is the ONLY way to win the war on black money.  Demonitization attacks stores of existing cash and forces people to learn new methods of payments.  But in the long term, it is only when the government can track each and every transaction that a person makes at the click of a button that the capacity to generate future black money will be drastically reduced.  (and yes, I'm ignoring other benefits of cashless economy such as lack of printing/storage/productivity wasted by getting and storing cash, etc)

Of course he is going to say cashless economy is a boon - Any economist who says going cashless for is bad is a fucking moron. Cashless economy is a boon however shoving it down people's throat by a democratic government isn't. The large majority of those bearing the brunt of demonetization policies are precisely the ones that aren't paying their legal share of taxes regardless of the infrastructure and systems that do facilitate their livelihoods. We live in a country where tax administration only reaches a small fraction of the population.

I'm not accusing them, I'm merely stating a fact. Having lived income-tax-free for decades means they've paid less than their expected share toward national interest. Subsequently having to change money and lose a sum in the transaction one day, or having to suffer the inconvenience of setting up a bank account isn't an unreasonable consequence. 

Many of them are poor but taxes are in some sense an investment for our peoples' future; having a functional society or lift hundreds of millions from poverty will require a budget. Generally speaking, we can have a drawn-out process of social and technological modernization and prolong poverty, or we can do more in shorter order with more resources. This is not something to be contested, this is all obvious, yet people will waste time arguing even the most basic logic.

We should be as creative as we can in our solutions to mitigate the costs of modernization. But there are few low-hanging fruit that will effect meaningful reform on national scale. It is true, one such demonetization even will not break the effect of black money on India; but as one piece of commitment to a multi-pronged, long-term strategy, we can make it work.

The key has to be that someone does something. Government in India often does not meet even this most basic requirement with respect to facilitating our social or technological development. We can argue day and night about everything, always starting from square one, always starting from the most basic philosophical assumptions, but we're guaranteed nothing will change if nothing is attempted.
Perhaps Modi has not done everything he could or should, maybe we can question his motives all day and night, but he has begun doing something, taking some calculated, novel risk, to produce national momentum. He has justified his own salary in some small way.

**India not China is among the fastest growing economies** 

 ______ 
The latest World Bank report about the economic health of the member countries clearly says that while India is among the fastest growing economies - big and small, China is not doing as well.

Chinese economy is slowing down. In its latest report, the World Bank has said, ""The continued gradual slowdown in China will slightly offset a pickup in the rest of the region led by a rebound among commodity exporters. Growth in China is anticipated to slow to 6.5 percent this year and 6.3 percent in 2018.""

According to the World Bank's latest edition of the Global Economic Prospects, India is the fourth fastest growing economy in the world. China shows a clear sign of slowdown and ranks at number 16 in terms of GDP growth rate.

INDIA PICKING UP

The World Bank has pegged India's growth rate at 7.2 for the current year on the back of rising export and increase in government spending.

Writing in the June edition of the Global Economic Prospects, the The World Bank analysts said, ""In India, recent data indicate an acceleration in growth, with an easing of cash shortages and a rise in exports. An increase in government spending, including on capital formation, has partially offset soft private investment.""

According to the World Bank, ""India is expected to accelerate to 7.2 per cent in fiscal 2017 (April 1, 2017 - March 31, 2018) and 7.5 per cent in the following fiscal year. Domestic demand is expected to remain strong, supported by policy reforms.""

CHINA SLIPS

In terms of growth rate, India is placed behind smaller economies of Estonia, Uzbekistan and Nepal. On the other hand, China failed to secure a place in the top 15 economies in terms of GDP growth rate.

The World Bank said, that though China has shown recovery in exports and the robust consumption pattern has helped it grow at 6.9 per cent in the first quarter, Beijing's slowdown is pulling down the east Asian region. Other countries in the region are showing better growth rates.

The World Bank has also expressed concern about exacerbating financial vulnerabilities of China on account of ""elevated domestic debt.""

According to the World Bank, the policy uncertainty in the United States and Europe is likely to impact Chinese growth rate more adversely. The trade, immigration and fiscal policies of the US are under review by the Donald Trump administration.

Similarly, the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union carries financial risks that could weigh on heavily on the China's growth prospects.

Fitch also warned that large stock of non-performing loans on bank balance sheets could dampen the outlook for credit growth and business investment. File photo: Bloomberg

New Delhi: Fitch Ratings has lowered India’s economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 6.9% from 7.4% after the gross domestic product (GDP) growth “unexpectedly faltered” in the April-June quarter.

The credit rating agency said however that it expects the economic activity to accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year with the waning impact of one-off events including the demonetisation shock in late 2016 and the goods and services tax (GST) rollout in July, which had dampened growth in the short term.

“The large stock of non-performing loans on bank balance sheets could, however, dampen the outlook for credit growth and business investment,” Fitch Ratings in its latest global economic outlook (GEO). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) had last month slashed India’s GDP growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7% from 7.4% owing to weakness in private consumption, manufacturing output and business investment.

India had posted a 7.1% growth in 2016-17. ADB pencilled in 7.4% for 2018-19, down from the earlier forecast of 7.6% in July. Fitch Ratings said the global economy has improved markedly this year and is on course to recording its fastest expansion since 2010.

India’s GDP growth at 5.7% in the first quarter (April-June), down from 6.1% in the previous year, is “the lowest outturn since early 2013, and GDP has now been cooling for five consecutive quarters”, it said. Economic activity in the quarter, it said, may have been disrupted by firms running down inventory ahead of the implementation of the GST in July.

The manufacturing sector lost steam in the quarter, growing at a meagre 1.2% year-on-year. The primary sector also dampened growth, while construction and tertiary activity bounced back. On the expenditure side, net trade was a big drag on growth, with exports decelerating sharply (after an admittedly strong January-March print) and import growth remaining buoyant (at 13.4% year-on-year).

“In light of the poor 1H17 (first half of 2017) outturns, we have downgraded our forecast for FY17-18 (year-ending March 2018) to 6.9 per cent, a cut of 0.5 percentage points compared to the June GEO,” Fitch said.

Forecasting acceleration in activity in the second half of the current fiscal, it said consumption should drive the pick-up in growth. “Motorcycle sales — a good indicator of rural household consumption — have gained strong momentum, bouncing back in July and August after having fallen sharply in 1H17. Investment is also expected to tick up in the quarters ahead, in part bolstered by ramped-up public sector infrastructure spending,” Fitch said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its policy rate to 6% in August, resuming the monetary easing cycle initiated in early 2015. “However, monetary policy loosening has taken place in the context of rapidly falling inflation, implying that the RBI’s policy stance as measured by the real policy rate has not been so accommodative,” it added.

The global economy has improved markedly this year but the current favourable mix of strong growth and highly accommodative macro policies could be as good as it gets, it said. “Our forecasts imply something of a ‘sweet spot’ for the global economy in 2017 and 2018 with above-trend growth and still highly accommodative global monetary policies. However, this is not a pattern we expect to persist into 2019 and beyond as output gaps close in advanced economies and monetary policy support is withdrawn,” said Brian Coulton, Fitch’s chief economist.

Global growth has been upgraded to 3.1% in 2017 from 2.9% in June, and 2018 growth has been upgraded to 3.2% from 3.1%.

Jagdish Bhagwati, Pravin Krishna,Suresh SundaresanOn November 8 Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a surprise reform to the nation: the government declared that the high-denomination 500 and 1000 rupee notes, which constituted more than 85% of currency outstanding in value, would be invalid as legal tender and could only be deposited into bank accounts until the end of the year.This is a courageous and substantive economic reform that, despite the significant transition costs, has the potential to generate large future benefits.



This is a courageous and substantive economic reform that, despite the significant transition costs, has the potential to generate large future benefits.India is largely a cash-driven economy, though a rapidly growing percentage of the population is becoming tech savvy. A shadow economy reliant on cash transactions and evading taxes, especially on high value transactions such as real estate purchases, gold, and intrinsically illegal activity, has taken deep and highly persistent root. Counterfeiting of Indian rupee notes and their subsequent use in funding of terrorist activities has also been an important concern.

This is incorrect, as the policy allows for the exchange of old notes for new notes. Although the process is inconvenient, and subjects many households to hardships, it forces the cash from the black economy to be deposited into the banking system, potentially increasing transparency and expanding the tax base and revenues to the government from taxes and surcharges.

The argument that the policy is anti-poor is suspect as a significant fraction of the taxes and surcharges that will be collected from the reform initiative is to be allocated to social programmes.

On the contrary, this action has been taken by duly elected officials within the framework of a democracy.To be effective, the policy required an element of surprise. Given this surprise factor and the magnitude of the reform, the rollout of the policy has generated predictable hardships.The shortage of new currency notes and limits on withdrawals has led to considerable anxiety about wage and pension payments, and cash financing of even routine household expenditures. The frequent changes in rules during the past month, over how money deposited into accounts will be taxed, how much money may be withdrawn and which exemptions would apply, for instance, have led to unnecessary confusion.

This move is hoped to motivate the transfer of wealth from the black economy to the banks.

Several recent developments suggest that the demonetisation drive may well yield significant benefits.First, around 80% of the currency in higher denominations has now been deposited back into bank accounts. Since individual deposits will now be matched with their tax returns and unaccounted deposits will be taxed, this will yield a windfall for the government permitting large increases in social expenditures.

**Living in denial**

The deceleration of growth in 2012 was policy induced. The trouble later was equally so. The deceleration of growth in 2012 was policy induced. The trouble later was equally so.

Delhi’s denials of reality would be funny if it weren’t for the tragic consequences. On the economy, this denial dates back to 2012 when Manmohan Singh was in charge and Rahul Gandhi has only now underlined that unemployment was the problem. Yashwant Sinha has edited a book on The Future of the Indian Economy and documented the continuing crisis.

Employment is only a part of the story. Arvind Panagariya was more direct. The corporate sector has performed well, he said. Investment output and employment have been rising. He took averages to make comparisons, which is not good statistics for analysis of short-run changes, for if there are three numbers 5, 10 and 15, the average is 5 but there is wild oscillation. Panagariya has written a good book on the Indian economy but he is not a great statistician. His use of averages to force the argument that the blip last year and this year will be reversed is flawed. Fortunately, his successor, Rajiv Kumar, says it is difficult but doable.

The deceleration of growth in 2012 was policy induced. The trouble later was equally so. The economy decelerated and voters correctly placed the blame on the UPA government and voted it out. Rahul Gandhi is absolutely correct in accepting the mistake on behalf of the then ruling party and saying that it needs to be corrected. Panagariya is too good an economist to ignore the non-corporate sector and its importance in the economy when the corporate sector is less than a tenth of the economy. In terms of output and employment, the non-corporate sector is important because jobs are created there. But for the sake of debating points, the fact that the national accounts data doesn’t show a rosy picture and includes performance of the non-corporate sector, was slurred over. Yashwant Sinha has also started a debate and in a piece in these columns established that the reversal of the slowdown was simply not there.

S. Gurumurthy had the courage to say that since Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s days, employment has been on the back burner. Half a problem is solved if a mistake is admitted and an amendment is made. But the empire struck back. On Rahul, a commentator close to the establishment said that speeches in America won’t matter in eastern UP. Another said that Berkeley and the Ivy League schools don’t matter. I went to the University of Pennsylvania, and also taught there, including at Wharton and Swarthmore College. Working as I do in Gujarat from 1968, I hold the motel owner-NRIs in high esteem. Many are engineers and so on, who went into motels since other options were not there when they settled in America, and being intelligent and well-trained, made a success of them. But the Ivy League and the professional crowd is also important, have strong connections at home and their opinion is respected in India. In fact, they remain more often than not more connected with India than the motel NRIs and so should definitely not be ignored.

Sinha asked the beleaguered establishment to get back to the drawing board. One commentator strangely argued that he was wrong because real rural wages have been rising. Abhijit Sen, now back at JNU, had pointed out a decade ago that the rural wage rate is rising but unemployment is there in a big way. This conundrum needs to be worked on rather than being wished away. Another commentator was to argue that imports are rising so Sinha must be wrong, but we are a continental economy. A senior minister could only abuse Sinha; strange since the finance and planning ministries have been known for their professional stance.

One can only hope that the policy response will be more professional. The so-called stimulus package should not just give us lectures on reform. Someday, we will get to one or maybe two rates and have a real GST, which then, after six months, will start working. Until then, we can call it a GST but with five rates it’s not unlike a sales tax. Some day, the demonetisation effects will wear off. Also please don’t end it all by telling the ministries to spend more efficiently based on existing financial allocations. If reports are correct, the captive secretary saying ‘yes sir’ must have gone out sniggering.

Efficiency doesn’t improve by lectures. Assuming that working styles will remain more or less the same, design a real stimulus. If you do your job and raise demand, the economy will respond magnificently.

____________________________________________________

Nearly six weeks after India abruptly scrapped high-denomination banknotes accounting for about 85% of its currency by value, the economy continues to slow. Poor and middle-class Indians are still suffering from the shortage of new bills. But the most significant casualty may well be Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reputation as a sound economic manager.

On Nov. 8, Mr. Modi announced that India’s two highest-denomination currency bills—1,000 rupees ($14.84) and 500 rupees—would immediately cease to be legal tender in most places. Holders have until the end of the year to deposit these bills into bank accounts. As replacements, the government has slowly rolled out a redesigned 500-rupee bill and a new 2,000-rupee bill.

The long-term effects of India’s demonetization gambit remain unclear, largely because no other major economy has attempted such an experiment except during a crisis. But with growth slowing and job losses rising, the short-term prognosis appears grim.

Instead of factory openings or large new investments, the images that tell India’s current economic story include snaking lines outside banks, distressed workers migrating back to their villages, and tax raids on jewelers and officials caught with hoards of allegedly illicit cash.

The policy’s shabby implementation—through an avalanche of amendments, rollbacks and patchwork fixes—undercuts Mr. Modi’s reputation for quiet efficiency. It also underscores his overreliance on India’s notoriously heavy-handed bureaucrats.

Demonetization has resurrected fears that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party takes policy advice from quacks. It damaged the credibility of India’s central bank. And it forced many of the country’s ostensibly right-of-center intellectuals to perform advanced mental gymnastics to defend the prime minister. Though a few economists have applauded Mr. Modi, the weight of informed opinion leans heavily against his decision.

Not surprisingly, shock waves from the announcement continue to crash through the economy. The Asian Development Bank cut its growth estimate for India for the financial year ending March 31 to 7% from 7.4%. JP Morgan expects growth to decline by half a percent to 6.7%.

Meanwhile, falling sales have begun to translate into layoffs spanning various sectors, including construction, textiles and jewelry. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy estimates the transaction costs alone of swapping out an estimated 14.2 trillion rupees’ worth of currency to be 1.28 trillion rupees, or about $19 billion.

India’s economy will eventually recover from this self-inflicted wound, but there’s no question that demonetization has created doubts about Mr. Modi’s competence. The decision, reportedly hatched in secret with a coterie of trusted bureaucrats, showcases the prime minister’s faith in the command-and-control ethos of the civil service rather than in the “minimum government” he once promised.

It also shows how susceptible Mr. Modi and his aides are to the unorthodox ideas of assorted cranks and oddballs from the Hindu nationalist movement to which the BJP belongs. The loudest backers of demonetization include a telegenic yoga guru, a chartered accountant best known for propounding the homespun economic philosophy of “swadeshi,” or self-reliance, and a nongovernmental organization that wants almost all taxes to be replaced by a single levy on bank transactions.

Already, a flurry of commentary by well-regarded Indian and global commentators has tarnished the prime minister’s image. The business journalist T.N. Ninan calls demonetization “a bad idea, badly executed on the basis of some half-baked notions.” For Morgan Stanley’s Ruchir Sharma, Mr. Modi’s “clumsy exercise of state power” won’t achieve its ostensible aim—cracking down on so-called “black money” salted away by tax dodgers. Kaushik Basu, a former chief economic advisor to the government of India and former chief economist at the World Bank, calls the policy “poorly designed, with scant attention paid to the laws of the market.”

To be sure, not everyone thinks demonetization is a disaster. Columbia University’s Jagdish Bhagwati calls it “a courageous and substantive economic reform” whose potential benefits include shrinking the shadow economy, hurting terrorists and counterfeiters, and expanding the tax base by digitizing many economic transactions.

Others argue that this is likely only the first of a series of reforms that will eventually simplify tax administration, root out corruption and make campaign finances more transparent. Some supporters view demonetization as a quick way to invigorate a sluggish banking sector with cheap funds.

Perhaps the optimists will be proved right, but at this point their gauzy hopes of future benefits must be weighed against the present pain. Even if demonetization ends up producing some gains, the question of whether it was worth its considerable costs will linger. Moreover, the simple fact that no credible expert suggested such a drastic policy before Mr. Modi announced it makes many arguments in its support look like belated apologia.

Two and a half years ago, based on his record as the business-friendly chief minister of Gujarat, Mr. Modi stormed to national power as India’s great economic hope. At least for now, the demonetization debacle has shaken this assumption to its foundations.

Time to bury the myth of competent Modi once and for all. Modi is totally out of his depth ffs. He's so incompetent. This is some Rahul Gandhi level shit Modi will probably start a war with Pakistan soon to distract everyone. The country’s bungling effort to cut down on cash has undermined Narendra Modi’s credibility, says Sadanand Dhume in The Wall Street Journal.

On 19 November, the Congress party kick-started celebrations to commemorate the birth centenary year of Indira Gandhi (hereafter referred to as Gandhi).

At a time when BJP is championing the image of prime minister Narendra Modi as a strong and decisive leader, the Congress party would be hoping to use Gandhi’s legacy to counter the ruling party and prime minister.

In an interview to India Today Television, Congress president Sonia Gandhi dismissed theories which equate Narendra Modi and Gandhi. While there is nothing new in the political slugfest being played out, a more interesting question is how should one evaluate Gandhi’s economic policies?

To analyse the performance of the Indian economy under Gandhi’s leadership, we have divided the post-independence period into three parts: 1952-1966, 1966-1984 and 1984 onwards. Gandhi was the prime minister from 1966-84 barring the period from 1977-1980. A simple comparison of growth rates shows that agricultural growth under Indira Gandhi’s tenure is the highest India has ever achieved. While overall growth rates have increased overtime in India, industry’s performance was the worst during Gandhi’s tenure.

In terms of per capita incomes, India started lagging behind China and southeast Asia when Gandhi was at the helm of affairs.

Gandhi’s own political rhetoric was more tilted towards providing a welfare state rather than delivering high growth, exemplified in her coining of the slogan Garibi Hatao (Eradicate Poverty). A reading of multiple Indian poverty estimates shows that poverty has declined at a much faster rate in post-reform India despite the dismantling of many of Gandhi’s policies. To be sure, there is a big debate on whether India’s current poverty lines guarantee adequate consumption and well-being levels. However, there is a broad agreement on the fact that poverty has declined faster in post-Gandhi India.

One statistic, which underlines the need for exercising caution vis-à-vis the positive picture painted by declining poverty figures is the rapid rise in inequality in India in the post-reform period. In fact, India was a more equal society than southeast Asia during Gandhi’s period. This trend has reversed itself today.

If there is one policy implemented by Gandhi which has left the most enduring impact on India’s political economy, it is the nationalisation of banks, which created a huge public sector bank network in India. The process was accomplished in two stages, first in 1969 and later in 1980.

Public sector banks have played a major role in the current problem of bad loans which plagues the Indian economy. Given the nexus between politicians controlling banks and businessmen, bank nationalisation policy is seen as a major culprit for the bad loan problem facing the Indian economy today. Public sector rigidities have also been seen as an obstacle to hiring talented executives and improving efficiency in India’s state owned banks.

However, it is also a fact that nationalisation of banks helped in furthering financial inclusion and improved access to institutional credit for people who did not have access to it earlier. Financial intermediation increased sharply in the post-nationalisation period. The state-led expansion of banking also helped in a doubling of savings rate in the economy from 10 percent in 1970s to 20% in 1980s. An increase in savings rate is seen as a crucial requirement for increasing investment and growth rate in any economy.

Caution should be observed in a mechanical reading of the statistics cited above as many policies often affect the economy with a lag. In fact, various economists have pointed towards the need to understand the complexities of political economy factors which drove economic growth in India. A 2004 National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working paper by Harvard economist Dani Rodrik and India’s Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian argues that the pro-business shift in Gandhi’s policies post 1980 was crucial in the growth rate picking up in the Indian economy. Similarly, a 2003 paper by Niti Aayog’s vice chairman Arvind Panagariya argues that acceleration in India’s GDP growth occurred during India’s fifth five year plan period (1974-79), while underlining the fact that growth revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s was more volatile in nature than the post-reform period.

At a time when India is the fastest-growing economy in the world, it is to be expected that the incumbent regimes would claim credit for the economic performance and dismiss the socialist rhetoric of the past of which Gandhi is an important icon.

However, it also remains a fact that despite faster growth, India stills lags behind most peers in human development outcomes.

The economic boom in southeast Asia and China helped these countries to significantly improve their human development indicators. Today, these countries are significantly ahead of India in terms of health and education levels. In fact, this gap started widening during the period when Gandhi was in power (see chart above). It remains to be seen whether a shift from Congress’s Garibi Hatao to Modi’s Cash Hatao will break this jinx.

My beef with this article is that it doesn't even mention Manmohan Singh and completely glosses over the monumental 1991 economic liberisation reforms. Singh set the stage for someone like Modi to become PM and continue the work increasing India's share of global GDP. 

Singh had to do battle with the License Raj, before Singh did away with the old License Raj system, it was almost impossible for even an upper-middle class Indian to become a successful entrepreneur. 

My point is without Singh, you don't get a Modi.  The article is peddling the myth that Indian decline began under the British. This is a lie. India's decline *continued* under the British. India would not have been taken over by the Brits if its decline had not started earlier, thereby making it weak, thus making it easier to conquer.

Indian GDP per capita was already declining by the time the British came. [Look at the change from 1600 to 1700](http://tinyurl.com/gurlh3p).

Other than this annoying habit, the article mostly says what is obvious, India will return to its rightful place in the coming decades at the forefront of economic might. Till about 300 years ago, India accounted for more than a quarter of the world's GDP. This share began falling following the advent of British power over the subcontinent.

**Moving towards an investment revival** 

 ______ 
Is corporate investment finally stirring to life? There are now a few silver
linings in what continues to be a dark sky. These rays of hope deserve more
attention than they are getting right now.

In its latest monetary policy statement released in early February, the
monetary policy committee of the Indian central bank said, as part of its
comments on the outlook for the Indian economy, that there are early signs of
“a revival in investment activity”. The panel that sets interest rates
believes the revival in global demand should help strengthen domestic
investment. Earlier, the World Bank had said in its June update on the global
economy that gross domestic capital formation—or investment—would overtake
private consumer spending in fiscal year 2019 as the main driver of Indian
economic growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also been expecting
a private sector investment recovery in the next fiscal year.

Much of this seems to fly in the face of an overwhelming fact: Indian industry
is still struggling with the problem of overcapacity. The production
facilities frenetically built during the previous economic boom have run into
the problem of weak domestic demand. However, the first synchronized recovery
in the global economy since the financial crisis could provide the export
demand needed for Indian companies struggling with excess capacity.

The industrial outlook surveys conducted every quarter by the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI) continue to show capacity utilization at a little over 70%. This
number needs to increase by at least 10 percentage points before companies get
back into investment mode. It is also widely known that the twin balance sheet
problem, or the mirror images of excess corporate leverage and a mountain of
soured bank loans, is a huge obstacle for private investment. Companies are
more focused on using cash flows from operations as well as asset sales to
reduce debt rather than invest in new capacity.

However, the global data is more reassuring. Many large economies have seen a
strong revival in corporate investment over the past few months, and it would
be unusual if Indian corporate investment did not pick up, though a lot
depends on what happens to the structural overcapacity in China as a result of
its investment bubble. The big policy gamble taken by the Donald Trump
administration in the US—of a large fiscal stimulus despite tight labour
markets—could blow another global bubble unless monetary policy is tightened
rapidly. But for now it will fuel strong global demand.

Much of the early data in India suggests that the game right now is capacity
expansion rather than building new facilities. The Mark To Market column
published in this newspaper cited the order trends in capital goods companies
such as ABB India, Siemens and Thermax to argue that brownfield investments
are seeing a recovery. There is less action as far as greenfield investments
go. The index of industrial production also suggests that capital goods
production is growing at a healthy clip, though it must be reiterated that
this segment of the factory output data is notoriously volatile.

There is widespread agreement that India cannot have sustainable growth
acceleration unless private sector investment picks up. The economy has till
recently been very heavily dependent on consumer spending plus public
investment by the government. The two other drivers of aggregate
demand—corporate investment and exports—have struggled. It is for this reason
that the recent green shoots are important.

A bit of recent economic history would help clarify why a recovery in private
sector investment matters for India. The two important economic booms in the
26 years since the 1991 economic reforms tell us an important story. Be it the
1994-97 acceleration or the one between 2004-08, it is clear that a
combination of a strong global economy plus a private sector investment boom
is needed to lift the underlying trend economic growth on a sustainable basis.
Consumer spending and government expenditure alone can take economic growth so
far—but no further.

Strong export growth to complement the recovery in domestic demand could help
companies deal with excess capacity. The deleveraging of corporate balance
sheets as well as the recapitalization of public sector banks can create space
for the financing of new industrial capacity. The battle against the
investment slump is far from over—but there is now reason to hope that the
worst is over.

it will not end happily, i assure you.  The article did not mention the role of Govt. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW5FRuMkQ6g That's the classical liberal or libertarian point of view, espoused by the Chicago School of Economics. That would be minarchism, neo-liberalism isn't necessarily the Austrian school.  This isn't really a question for economists but more for political scientists, but that's just semantics. 

Neo-liberal refers to the 'original' liberalism, that is the liberalism that developed during the 17th-18th century that advocated for government to have limited power and to vest greater power in the individual. Theoretically this means the government serves as minimal a role as possible- upholding laws through courts and police forces, providing national defence, etc.

The issue is that 'law and order' as 'justice' are broad terms that aren't clearly defined. For instance, you can and people have argued that banning alcohol is a government move to uphold law and order, as less drunkards will cause trouble or beat their wives or commit assault. You can argue that reservation policies are a policy to uphold justice, to correct the injustice of generations of caste discrimination and such. 

Naturally neo-liberalism vests a lot of power and freedom in the private sector. That said, anti-trust and pro-competition regulations are another key role for the government to play.  When Jhootly and call drop mantri fails to auction spectrum to its potential and loot the exchequer. /s Govt Role - Providing basic services like public transport,good roads, water and electricity (which can be contracted to private players) and govt. schools and maybe govt. universities

Federal Govt. - National Security, Defence and Foreign Policy and helping states in facilitating economic growth and fund central universities, access to afordable healthcare (doesn't mean running govt. hospitals) and enforce contracts and regulate.

State Govt. - Law and order, ensuring the above services are delivered, fund state universities and ensure facilitation of economic growth by removing roadblocks for businesses, slash redtape, repeal redundant state laws and enforce the laws.

All other economic activity like running companies must be done by private players. That's the conservative way of thinking, not liberal. ",1478512190.0,1,19,0,31,"I was reading an article, and it piqued my curiosity.

**India officials trek through villages to map rising joblessness** 

 ______ 
New Delhi: As India’s infamous summer heat started to rise this April, hundreds of researchers began a trek through villages and cities seeking answers to one of the country’s enduring policy puzzles — jobs. The answer could shape Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s re-election bid in 2019.

The South Asian nation’s most ambitious jobs survey to date will reveal annual employment numbers for the whole country and quarterly estimates for its growing cities. That’s a significant change from the current system where the latest numbers are at least one-year old.

More From Livemint »

“This data will bridge a huge gap,” said Pronab Sen, country director at the New Delhi-based International Growth Centre and India’s former chief statistician. “This survey will give us an idea of the size of the GDP of India’s informal sector — there’s no other major economy with such high levels of informality,” he said. More than 90% of workers exist in the grey economy — unaccounted for in any official statistics — which complicates efforts to track unemployment.

India has so far lacked a reliable policy tool in the form of real-time employment numbers to help policy makers and its central bank. Labour is governed by both federal and state governments and data collection is scattered, with seven federal agencies publishing reports, according to the Statistics Ministry.

Poll promises

Before sweeping to power in the biggest election win in 30 years, Modi appealed to young job-seekers — more than half of the population — with a promise to create 10 million jobs. Three years later it remains unclear how many positions have been created. While his critics say Modi’s biggest failure so far has been his inability to increase formal employment, officials in his government say the claims of jobless growth are a “bit bogus.”

Bloomberg

Failure could risk voter backlash over jobs — an issue already driving protests in some parts of the country — and lead to even more divisive campaigning in the lead up to the country’s national elections.

“The nation will come to know whether prime minister Modi has been able to fulfill his electoral promise of creating jobs,” said Satish Misra, an analyst at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. “It will be an answer to India’s unemployment puzzle.”

Jagdish Thakkar, a spokesman in the Prime Minister’s Office, didn’t return calls seeking comment.

Disappearing employment

While India is one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, employment creation in eight sectors, including textiles and automobiles, was the slowest in seven years, according to a 2016 Ministry of Labour report. More than 12 million Indians enter the workforce every year, government data show. Between 2011 to 2015, the number of agricultural jobs reduced by 26 million while non-farm ones rose 33 million, according to McKinsey Global Institute.

Bloomberg

The government has trained more than 700 researchers to feed data directly on to tablets instead of the usual paper questionnaires, according to Rakesh Kumar, additional director general of the National Sample Survey Office.

More than 100,000 sample households across 7,500 villages and 5,000 urban blocks will be questioned every quarter to generate closer-to-real-time information, creating seven quarters worth of credible and comparable quarterly and annual labour data for the first time, Kumar said. The first tranche of data is expected to be revealed in December next year.

Data delinquency

The survey may also be the first set of comparable economic data from India since 2015 when Modi’s government initiated changes to how the nation plots economic indicators like inflation and gross domestic product. Policy makers and economists have puzzled over new GDP and inflation calculations that catapulted India to become the world’s fastest-growing major economy.

The picture was muddled further in November last year after the prime minister overnight cancelled 86% of currency in circulation.

With its landmark goods and services tax launched on 1 July, calculations used to compile GDP and inflation data are also expected to be out of sync for at least a few months.

Yet, in a country where fewer than 5% of people declare their incomes and 1% pay income tax, the GST will help improve GDP calculations by making available high quality, granular data, according to Neelkanth Mishra, managing director and India equity strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG.

Timely release

India’s decision to use Soviet-style five-year plans to plot its economy is another reason for the country’s data delinquency, Mishra said in a phone interview from Mumbai. Modi replaced those plans with a three-year strategy released earlier this year by the government’s planning body NITI Aayog, which discusses “high-productivity, high-wage jobs”.

Yet, there’s some apprehension about whether the government will keep to its timetable to release the labour survey. The task force formed last month under NITI Aayog’s vice chairman Arvind Panagariya recommended an employment survey every three years.

“It seems the data may not go in his government’s favour as there is not much evidence of job creation because of slow down of economy and demonetisation,” said ORF’s Misra about whether Modi will release the jobs survey findings next December. “In that case he will not allow the data to be released few months before the election — if he releases, it will be a bold step.” Bloomberg

On the other hand Duterte called Obama ""son of  a whore"" twice, and Trump, well he's said ""global warming is a Chinese hoax"" to be laughing stock of the world. Because Modi has been doing well in foreign policy. His fuck-ups are primarily domestic. Also, botching demonetisation cannot be compared to the bloodletting in the Philippines. 

Trump also gets enormous amount of attention because the US is the only superpower in the world. Aside from that, he has a habit of overtweeting about foreign policy. He just sent US/China relations into a tizzy because of his stance on Taiwan over a few tweets.

Modi is not more competent than they are, but India still has a lower profile than either. The Philippines isn't as important than India, but the reason why Duterte gets attention is the China connection. Moving away from the US to China gets attention in the Western press, so they try to discredit him. It's a way of warning others.

Also, up until now, Modi had an aura of competence. If he keeps these fuckups going for a few more years, you'll see opinion turning. I'm already seeing NRIs writing self-serving articles how ""Modi is not like Trump at all"". Well, no, but the differences are not amazing either. Modi is, if anything, even more xenophobic than Trump. He constantly invokes foreigners as a weapon to bash others(as recently seen re: Pakistan against demonetisation critics, his dark insinuations about Sonia Gandhi and her foreign roots etc, his rants against Bangladeshi illegal immigrants during the 2014 election and so on. All Trumpian and then some) I still don't understand how he would've gotten that much respect in the first place, considering his dubious past. I would say he's close to Erdogan in that they're both right wing, but Modi is currently _passively_ right wing while Erdogan is _actively_ so, in a lot of ways. Duerte is a raving lunatic, so I don't think we've descended to that level. At least he never really publically admitted to have killed a person in cold blood. Trump, is vastly different from all the other four. He has no politics - he sways with the wind (read money). He is a joke, and I say that even after he got elected.

Who is laughing at Dueterret? From when killing people in name of justice become laughing stock?

**India’s imminent economic crisis** 

 ______ 
To foster higher growth, authorities need to focus on productivity enhancing structural reforms that would encourage the private sector to invest in India. Photo: Mint

Poor macroeconomic management, both by the central bank and political regimes over the past several years, is leading India toward an imminent vicious cycle of low growth and high inflation, making it exceedingly vulnerable to emerging domestic and geopolitical risks. The low growth-high inflation scenario will lead to higher fiscal and current account deficits, consequent capital outflows, a weaker currency and a lack of confidence in the economy among investors. The authorities need to undertake meaningful structural reforms and loosen monetary and exchange rate policy at the earliest to arrest the decline before it culminates in an external and financial crisis. A loose fiscal policy (increased government expenditure) at this juncture with a likely low fiscal multiplier would be counterproductive and accelerate the pace of economic decline.

Economic growth in India has likely been lower than the 7% rate that has been estimated by the Central Statistical Authority for the past two-three years. A sustained 7% gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been inconsistent with other major indicators, including credit, investment, index of industrial production, and exports growth slowing for at least the past four years. A slower 5.7% official GDP growth in 2QFY18 is therefore not surprising. In fact, before the switch to a new series of GDP numbers in early 2015, GDP growth estimates were 4.7% for FY14, according to the old series. New methodology introduced in the new series raised them to 6.7% for FY14, inconsistent with other indicators. Amongst other flaws, value added in manufacturing, which has been consistently significantly higher than other indicators would suggest, is arrived at from a corporate financial database maintained by the ministry of corporate affairs. It would be impossible to arrive at a true measure of value added in manufacturing from financial accounting data for even a few large firms such as Reliance, especially in an era where production of goods and services is becoming increasingly integrated.

Economic output and growth depend mainly on productivity growth and on increases in labour and capital; most commentators mistakenly tend to focus instead on the uses of this output—consumption, investment and exports. Productivity growth, the main driver of growth, depends on structural reforms that would require better institutions and improving human skills.

Structural reforms are reforms aimed at changing the structure of the economy to make it more market-oriented, and consequently efficient and productive. India needs to focus on reforms in several areas—liberalizing markets, legal, civil service, tax structure, financial sector, education, and labour, amongst others. In competitive markets, any price different from the market-determined one (e.g. controls such as minimum or maximum prices) leads to a decline in output, ensuring reduced GDP.

To foster higher economic growth and job creation, the authorities need to focus on productivity enhancing structural reforms that would encourage the private sector—domestic and foreign—to invest in India. Specifically, the innumerable controls on markets and administered prices need to be freed up, including food and agricultural prices, water, electricity, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, seeds and railways, amongst others that reduce output and lead to a misallocation of resources. The direct tax structure needs to be simple and transparent with retrospective taxes eliminated. Public sector banks need to be recapitalized and privatized. The education system needs to be opened up to investors—domestic and foreign—as a profit-making sector, both at the school and higher education levels. These are minimal measures to attract investments.

The inexplicably tight monetary policy of high interest rates and overvalued exchange rate have been damaging to the economy. The insistence of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to engage in foreign exchange market intervention to maintain an overvalued currency has encouraged further volatile debt inflows. This has increased India’s external vulnerability and inhibited financial markets development.

Overall, RBI’s high interest rate and overvalued exchange rate policy has hurt credit growth, especially to industry, hurt firm-level debt sustainability and in turn bank balance sheets, and damaged exports and domestic industry further via cheaper imports. India is the only major economy in Asia with a negative credit gap (deviation from trend), according to the International Monetary Fund.

Fiscal policy has largely been unimaginative and a tighter fiscal policy with tight monetary policy has meant no policy support for growth over the past several years. Tax policy has mainly been one of raising tax rates—excise duties on petrol and diesel mainly and service tax rates that have increased from 12% to 18% over the last three years. At the same time, little effort has been made to simplify tax rules; indeed, the new goods and services tax structure with multiple rates is the most complicated globally. This structure with a smattering of controls has kept money out of India.

The fiscal multiplier is low; around 0.3 for emerging economies, according to some estimates. This means an increased fiscal expenditure of Rs40,000 crore (0.3% of GDP) being mentioned in the press would yield a negligible additional growth of 0.1% to GDP, raising growth from 5.7% to 5.8%.

The costs of this misguided fiscal expansion (government expenditure) could be significantly high. It would not lead to sustainable growth or increased investments from the private sector. The larger fiscal deficit, along with slowing growth reducing tax revenue, and a consequent worsening fiscal situation would lead to more borrowing from the RBI. At the same time, the deteriorating economic situation would lead to capital outflows, slowing the economy further, draining liquidity from the system and raising interest rates, further dampening economic growth.

To conclude, the government needs to undertake structural reforms on a war-footing to encourage investments to grow the economy and increase revenue growth. Interest rates need to be reduced by the RBI. Misadventures such as expansionary fiscal policy will not be sustainable and will lead to low growth, higher fiscal deficit, high inflation, less competitiveness that would trigger capital outflows and lead to an external and also a financial crisis if financial sector weaknesses are not addressed.

Last week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government’s actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy—something long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.

If indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country’s economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.

Both are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.

The other is the result of structural disruptions—some of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.

So while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.

It is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.

As such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming—especially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential—which some argue is around 8-8.5%—as the government’s spin doctors are arguing.

This potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.

Alongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over—indeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.

In a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).

Similarly, the government’s anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework—exactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.

The Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.

“The deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI’s initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,” and then added, “We believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks’ balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.”

In the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.

The Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.

Even though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.

**Calls to weaken rupee are misguided** 

 ______ 
Rather like Goldilocks, commentators on the Indian rupee don’t like the value of the currency too low or too high—they would like it just right. Thus, when the rupee is weak, there are complaints that it is too weak; with a strong rupee, there are complaints that it is too strong. It is understandable that industry shills should press for a weakening of the rupee. But it is not just those with a vested interest in promoting domestic industry who are crying foul— eminent economists have now joined the fray. In this newspaper, former chief economic adviser Deepak Nayyar and economist Ajit Ranade have batted for a weaker rupee in the past few weeks. Nayyar, in particular, is explicit that this is best achieved through lowering the policy interest rate, which, it is alleged, is too high.

Unfortunately, such arguments suffer from the fallacy of thinking that the tail wags the dog. It is not that the rupee is too strong relative to the US dollar, but rather that the US dollar is weak—relative to a wide range of currencies, not just the rupee.

The figure shows a broad trade-weighted US dollar index from July 2016 to the present, and this clearly reveals that after a period of steady appreciation culminating approximately at the time that Donald Trump was inaugurated US president, the dollar has been steadily depreciating.

The rupee’s initial weakening followed by strengthening is a mirror image of this. Indeed, the dollar shows broadly similar behaviour vis-a-vis a range of advanced and emerging economy currencies. The fundamental driver is perhaps the market’s sense that Trump’s economic programme—tax cuts and infrastructure spending—is floundering. It is noteworthy that even with monetary tightening, the dollar has been weakening.

The real story is thus of dollar weakness, not rupee strength, and this turns the analysis on its head. For there is little if anything that Indian monetary authorities can—or should—do in the face of a fluctuating dollar, beyond attempting to smooth excess volatility. As it happens, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does intervene in currency markets, exactly for this reason, not to alter the underlying market-determined path of the exchange rate.

There is a second key proposition that critics miss. In a world of open capital markets, and in which the central bank wishes to pursue an independent monetary policy—in the case of India and many others, that choice is inflation targeting—we must, perforce, accept that the nominal exchange rate will be largely market-determined. In other words, you cannot simultaneously pursue an independent monetary policy and control the exchange rate—a fundamental insight that we owe to the Nobel economist Robert Mundell and to which many critics seem strangely oblivious.

Unless critics would like India to abandon our inflation-targeting monetary policy regime and substitute it with a fundamentally different system, such as fixing the exchange rate to the US dollar or something else equally radical, they cannot simultaneously grumble about the interest rate and the exchange rate in an open economy.

It is perfectly possible to debate whether the global economy is in need of systemic monetary reform, but that is very different from suggesting that India, acting alone, should abandon inflation targeting in favour of a more exotic policy approach. And, if we accept inflation targeting, or indeed any conventional flexible exchange-rate monetary policy regime, we must accept that the value of the rupee will be basically market-determined, full stop.

The truth is this: Those at present batting for a lower policy rate and/or a weaker rupee are, it would appear, concerned primarily with the interests of domestic Indian industry, not Indian consumers— who stand to benefit from a stronger rupee to the extent that, for instance, they purchase foreign goods or travel abroad— or indeed the economy as a whole.

Let us not forget that an artificially weakened currency can make up, at least for a while, for a multitude of sins, such as low productivity in domestic industry, and that is another reason why industry pushes for it. Why become more competitive and more efficient when, hey presto, your friendly neighbourhood central banker can bid down the value of the currency and let you stand on stilts for a while? This is an old trick. For instance, Canada for years cushioned low domestic productivity with a depreciated currency.

The RBI’s monetary policy committee is correctly focused on achieving the inflation-target mandate, and ought not to get distracted by the red herring that a strong rupee is hurting the economy.

**A credibility deficit in statistics** 

 ______ 
The Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) on 29 May. This is the first estimate for a full year after the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) took over. The growth rate of GDP at 7.3% at constant prices is not only better than the last year of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) but also makes India the fastest growing economy in the world. At a time when the world economy is showing signs of slowing, the performance of the Indian economy judged by these numbers should be cause for cheer. The fact that India’s economy grew faster than China’s may give the impression that all is well, despite fears of rural distress across India.

Unfortunately, nobody seems to be happy with these numbers. Not only has the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised the red flag doubting these numbers in its policy review, even the finance ministry has advised caution while interpreting these numbers. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has decided to send a team to understand the new GDP numbers put up by the CSO. Even the financial media, which should have lapped up these numbers, has shown maturity while reporting them.

India’s statistical agency is well-regarded not only in India but also internationally, but the new GDP numbers pose a serious challenge to its credibility. While the CSO did bring out an explanatory fact sheet, thus far, its attempts to explain these numbers have not worked—partly because the explanations have been largely in terms of accounting and the arithmetic of national accounting, with very little clarity on the nature of changes and the sources of divergence between the new series and the old series.

It is not the arithmetic that is being questioned; the very basis of growth that seems to be at variance with the optimistic picture being presented by the national accounts. The high growth rate of GDP is attributed largely to the better-than-average performance of services and manufacturing with agriculture, mining and construction showing deceleration. The growth rate of manufacturing at 7.1% is not only at variance with the growth rate of Index of Industrial Production (IIP) at 2.3% but is also at variance with the reported sales of automobiles, tractors and many other manufactured goods, all of which show deceleration in sales and production. For the record, sales of commercial vehicles last year declined by 2.8%.

Even for the services sector, the growth rates appear far too optimistic. Profits of companies do not reflect this optimism; nor do sales figures, which are subdued compared with the numbers reported in the national accounts estimates. Other data, such as exports and investment data, are also at variance with the rosy picture presented by the CSO. Clearly, there is something missing as far as the GDP numbers are concerned. Quite simply, the whole is not the sum of parts as expected in an accounting sense.

One of the reasons offered by the CSO for the variance has been the change in methodology of arriving at these numbers. To keep up with international practices, the CSO changed the methodology of computing GDP and its aggregates. As a result, the manufacturing growth rate, which was earlier based on the IIP and the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) data on volume and value-added growth, now also takes into account the advance tax filing data maintained by the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA). This practice of using tax data extends to the services sector as well, unlike the earlier series which used volume-based indices.

While the new series may be consistent with the best practices adopted internationally, doubts remain. These are not only related to the conceptual framework for measuring growth in sectors and sub-sectors of the economy but also to the coverage of the MCA database. This is particularly a problem of developing countries, where the informal/unorganized sector still constitutes a large part of the economy. Serious questions have also been raised by Prof. R. Nagaraj—a member of the committee which recommended the use of MCA data—not only on the completeness of the data but also the methodology adopted to blow up the estimates.

It is obvious that the new series raises far too many questions than it has answered so far. A reasonable approach to such drastic changes would have included a wider discussion among the academic community as well as media dissemination before the new series was adopted. By maintaining secrecy on these, the CSO has not only messed up its communication strategy but also done considerable damage to its credibility.

The matter is not only about statistical methods and estimates. The issue of national accounts is also fundamental to the understanding of what is happening to different sectors of the economy and the way different sectors respond to various policy measures. A discredited database not only does injustice to the statistical system of the country but also hinders policy response needed for long term growth by giving mixed signals.

The main criticisms were that Index of Industrial Production (IIP) growth data was at odds with manufacturing growth in the 2011-12 series. The new IIP 2011-12 series released seems to reconcile these numbers and hence an upward revision. 

Second, there has been no back series of GDP or GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) released based on 2011-12 prices. So essentially, we have estimates 2011-12 onwards and we have earlier estimates based on 2004-05 prices.

New Delhi: India could face significant short-term economic costs from the ban on large-denomination currency notes, with no significant long-term benefits, economist Paul Krugman warned on Friday.

The 2008 Nobel Prize-winning economist said there is a good case to be made for not having high-value currency notes, but noted that India’s “unusual move” of discontinuing old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes was only a one-time effort to flush out hoarded money, and not to eliminate the denominations forever.

“I understand the motivation, but it is a highly disruptive way to do it. I hardly see significant long-run gains, but there certainly are significant, although temporary, costs,” Krugman, a professor at The Graduate Center, City University of New York, said at the Hindustan Times Leadership summit.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 8 November scrapped the high-denomination currency notes in a crackdown on unaccounted wealth, tax evasion, terror finance and counterfeit currency. The move took out 86% of the value of currency in circulation, and economists have warned that it would dent consumer demand in the short term, set back gains to agriculture from a bountiful monsoon and harm productivity.

One of the reasons for Krugman’s disapproval of demonetisation as part of a drive to tackle income tax evasion is his belief that it is practically difficult for developing economies with large unorganized sectors to raise the share of taxes as a proportion of GDP by relying too much on income taxes.

Also read: GST roll-out by September 2017 is a constitutional compulsion, says Arun Jaitley

Although considered regressive, indirect taxes, such as the central excise duty and service tax levied by the central government in India and value added tax (VAT) by states, are more practical tools to raise tax revenue, he said. Indirect taxes are generally considered regressive as they affect the rich and the poor alike, unlike income tax, the burden of which increases progressively on tax payers with high income levels.

India is now leading the discussions among G20 nations for a multilateral framework to prevent income tax evasion, especially corporate tax, based on principles laid down by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a group of developed economies.

“Trying to have an OECD style income tax system in a country which has a per capita GDP far below OECD levels is not doable,” Krugman said.

The American economist said India could be hit by a recession in China stemming from declining investment, but has no reason to worry about the US turning more protectionist under Donald Trump.

Krugman said it would be difficult for China to sustain investments as a share of GDP and a readjustment can spell trouble for other economies including India.

“China cannot continue its previous investment-driven growth model. How can you manage the large scale of adjustment without a massive recession?. China looks to me ready to blow up,” said Krugman.

He doesn’t see much of an impact on India from the US possibly taking steps to protect its jobs, including from the services sector in India.

“I do not see a short-run macroeconomic crisis (in the US). If anything, policy will shift to fiscal expansion. Extremely unwise long-run policy does not necessarily carry a short-run cost. Economics is not a morality play. You can have bad policies turning out to be catastrophic a generation from now, but that does not necessarily bring a recession now. The US is not going to be a drag on the world economy, but If China blows up, it is going to be a drag on the world economy,” said Krugman.

He added that not being a trade surplus country will work to India’s advantage in this context. The comment comes in the backdrop of US president elect Donald J Trump’s economic policies widely being taken to be protectionist and hence likely to rattle a still recovering global economy.

Krugman said unlike China or Brazil, India will not be at the receiving end of any protectionist measure by the US.

Krugman attributes the current weak global economic growth to a chronic weakness in demand, which was not the outcome of the asset bubble and financial crisis of 2008, but something which ran deeper.

“There is a an underlying inadequacy in spending, which was masked by the asset bubble. The preponderance of evidence now is that this is the new normal that we need to live in a world which does not want to spend enough to keep itself fully employed,” Krugman said. “Unlike earlier thought, high level of public debt due to the economic stimulus that nations doled out in the last few years, now looks misplaced as interest rates are low.”

Krugman also called for a big burst of fiscal expansion in the world economy after which one could think of resetting policies.

**Central bank liquidity withdrawal: Short-term uncertainty can be long-term opportunity** 

 ______ 
Recently, we have seen huge sell-off in the global bond market as nervousness deepened that central banks are moving toward reducing stimulus efforts that have supported debt markets Almost all the central banks be it the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, the Bank of England or the Bank of Canada, each one is preparing the markets for a gradual withdrawal from accommodative monetary policies.The global economy is experiencing synchronous growth, labor markets are improving and consumer spending and business investment have picked up. However inflation is running below central banks’ targets. The recent data on inflation shows that there is a pickup in inflation but it still remains below desired levels in most developed economies.The minutes of the US Federal Open Market Committee’s June policy discussions shower a split over inflation. Minutes from the ECB released indicated that the ECB was worried about how best to communicate increasing confidence in the eurozone economy without roiling market. The news of shifting monetary policy trajectories of central banks have led to the volatility in both stock market and Forex market.The Bank of Japan and the European Central banks are scheduled to meet on July 20 and Fed interest rates decision is scheduled on July 26. Though Fed Chair Yellen has said that the US economy is healthy enough for the Fed to proceed with plans to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio, but it is expected that Fed would slow the pace of rate hikes down the road and interest rates would remain historically low over the longer term.Emerging economies including India have undoubtedly been benefited from the environment of lower interest rates.Among all major economies, the interest rate regime in India only is on a downward trajectory.Meanwhile, recent data pointed to slowing industrial production growth and to a falling retail price inflation has given room to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to resort to accommodative stance from neutral at the review meeting on August 2.The markets know that the long period of low rates has to end sometime and a gradual normalisation of policy rates may not necessarily impact the stock markets. However, a sudden change in yield expectations may cause volatility in the market. As the fundamentals of the Indian economy are strong, any inorderly tapering by the major central bankers would have limited impact on the Indian stock market.So, it is advised to use any dip into the market as buying opportunity and remain invested for long term as India is a bright spot among its peer though its valuation looks rich.

The analytical solution would help the income tax department gather data received from banks, post offices and other sources for linking of information and identification of duplicate details.

New Delhi: To plug tax loopholes, the income tax (I-T) department will use Big Data analytics to track down evaders by collecting information such as common address, mobile number and e-mail to establish relationship between their multiple PANs. The department, with support from private firms, will analyse the voluminous data available post demonetisation for checking relationships between PAN holders.

The managed service provider (MSP), which the I-T department plans to hire, will design and operationalise analytical solution that will help collating data, matching it and identifying relationships as well as clustering of PAN and non-PAN data, an official said.

The analytical solution would help the department gather data received from banks, post offices and other sources for linking of information and identification of duplicate details. It will also identify records with errors or other defects for resubmission.

“The data quality errors and defects will be communicated to the reporting person or entities, say, banks or post offices for correction and improving data quality,” the official added.

The data integration and matching of the PAN based demonetisation information with that of I-T databases such as tax returns, TDS, third-party reporting, tax payments, would be used to build a comprehensive profile for the taxpayer. It will help identify link between PAN holders on the basis of relationships (business association, asset and transactional association) available in various databases, the official said, adding that the analytics will do clustering of PAN-linked demonetised data using identified relationships as well as common address, mobile number, e-mail and bank branch.

Also, it will cluster non-PAN demonetised data using common name, address, mobile number, e-mail and bank branch. Taxpayer segmentation on the basis of taxpayers’ status, type of ITR form used, nature of business, taxpayer segment, age of the individual and compliance history will also have to be prepared. It will prioritise demonetisation data based on taxpayer segment, relationships, clusters, rules and risk matrix.

“Different types of interventions (send e-mail, SMS, outbound call, letter, notice, verification, investigation) can be selected for taxpayer priority and segment,” the official added.

**Is the golden age over for emerging markets?** 

 ______ 
The answer to that question is probably yes, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A chapter in its latest World Economic Outlook warns emerging economies they can no longer count on the benign external environment that had led to high economic growth in their economies in the last few decades.

It warns of “fading external tailwinds, including waning potential growth in advanced economies, slowdown and rebalancing in China, and a shift in the commodity cycle that has affected commodity exporters”. It says that, “Together with a risk of protectionism in advanced economies and tighter financial conditions as US monetary policy normalizes, these changes make for a more challenging external environment for emerging market and developing economies going forward.”

The chart paints a broad picture. It shows how the contribution of emerging markets to world growth increased from 18.2% during 1976-79 to 69.82% during 2010-15. The contribution of developing countries to world consumption rose even more markedly—from 13.9% during 1976-79 to 72% in 2010-15. But the rise of emerging markets is an old story. What’s new are the projections—the IMF forecasts that the contribution of emerging economies to both global growth and consumption will decrease during the period 2016-2021, as the chart indicates. True, the decrease is not much, but it does mark a turning point from the hefty increases of earlier decades.

How important are external conditions for growth in emerging markets? The IMF article says a 1 percentage point increase in domestic absorption by a country’s trading partners translates into around a fifth of the annual average growth in GDP per capita in emerging markets. And secondly, a 1 percentage point increase in the ratio of capital flows to GDP of emerging market and developing economies raises medium-term growth by 0.2 percentage points.

Taken together with higher growth on account of better terms of trade for commodities, the IMF estimates that over the past two decades, these factors accounted for more than half of medium-term growth, on average, across emerging market and developing economies. In turn, about half of the contribution to growth from external factors is due to higher capital inflows to emerging markets.

Will India too be affected? Well, India is one of those countries where domestic demand has been the mainstay of growth. But we shouldn’t underestimate the important part that external demand has played in supplementing that growth. One very important element of India’s liberalisation story and of its growth pick-up after liberalisation is the increase in its share of exports of goods and services to GDP from 6.8% in 1990-91 to 25% in 2013-14. The most rapid spurt happened in the early noughties, during the period of the global boom, when the ratio went up from 12.6% in 2001-02 to 23.7% in 2008-09.

As the IMF report says, “a favourable impulse from external demand and financial conditions helps medium-term growth outcomes by making growth accelerations more likely. It also reduces the likelihood of growth reversals.”

That’s not all. The rise in fund flows to the Indian stock markets during the noughties led to a boom in the secondary and primary equity markets, allowing companies to raise capital easily and lowering their cost of capital. This, in turn, sparked an investment boom and also led to higher employment, higher wages and consequently, to higher consumption. As the IMF says, “Capital inflows can enhance growth in emerging market and developing economies through various channels: augmentation of funds available for investment, transmission of crucial know-how and technological diffusion, and adoption of market discipline and better governance practices.”

Given the importance of the external sector, what then can be done to mitigate the impact of the headwinds mentioned above? The IMF believes that, faced with a potentially less supportive external environment than in the past, emerging market and developing economies can get the most out of a weaker growth impulse from external conditions by strengthening their institutional frameworks and adopting a policy mix that protects trade integration; permits exchange rate flexibility; and ensures that vulnerabilities stemming from high current account deficits and external debt, as well as high public debt, are contained.

These are all standard text-book remedies, but complying with them will be all the more important in a less benign external environment.

The markets, fixated perhaps on the short term, seem to be ignoring these long-run risks outlined by the IMF. As a recent Bank for International Settlements paper by Luis Awazu Pereira de Silva and Elod Takats says, “We are witnessing a departure from the policies of trade integration and multilateral cooperation that have been our successful recipe for the last 50 years. Is it purely rhetorical or real? Temporary or lasting? Is it linked to the current backlash against globalisation? Therefore, there is a disconnect between market exuberance and policy uncertainty. There are indeed threats to trade, financial integration and international cooperation that benefited both AEs and EMEs. These threats are increasing.”

**Opinion: Modi's Approach To China Has Done Us Proud** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government's decision to not send an envoy to China's big
Belt and Road Forum (abbreviated, incredibly, BARF) has been the cause of much
wailing and gnashing of teeth in New Delhi. Given the fact that India is
practically the only large economy to not be represented there - and that
dozens and dozens of countries have sent representatives, many the heads of
their governments - it has come across to some people as the Modi government
deliberately choosing to isolate India. It has been criticised thus as
stubborn opposition to an initiative that has seized the world's imagination.

Well, if Modi has isolated India on this issue, so be it. He and his foreign
policy establishment deserve praise for taking a bold stand of dissent on
grounds that are both principled and realist.

The government's thinking on this issue is unusually clear and well-
articulated. The Ministry of External Affairs released a statement that
""connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility
to avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden for communities;
balanced ecological and environmental protection and preservation standards;
transparent assessment of project costs; and skill and technology transfer to
help long term running and maintenance of the assets created by local
communities."" It is worth noting that India's legitimate objections to the
path of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC - one of the sub-
initiatives of One Belt One Road or OBOR - also got a mention, but were
clearly rhetorically subordinate to the larger, principled objection about the
sustainability issues involved.

While India is the only large economy to not send a representative to BARF, it
is not as if it has received universal acclaim among those who have gone. The
Guardian reported that the European Union has abstained from some of the
resolutions the Chinese expected them to sign up to, citing environmental
reasons. Nor has the United States sent a senior official. So even the talk of
""isolation"" is not entirely true. Not every large country is willing to sign
up to Beijing's vision of a Middle Kingdom-centric global economy, but India
is the only major country willing to take a clear and visible stand on the
subject, and of that we can be proud.

Let's be clear: this does not mean that Indian companies may not take
advantage of OBOR connectivity, wherever it does get built. This is a free
country and a (relatively) free economy, and nobody will stop an Indian
manufacturer from using railway lines somewhere else in the world paid for by
China, if it helps their business. The private sector is not the government.
It is for the government, however, to take the long strategic view on what
OBOR connectivity will mean for the world, our neighbourhood, and our own
position in the global economy - and they have correctly decided that it will
not, on balance, be beneficial. Nor is this about distrusting China in
particular. India is more than willing to cooperate with China on
infrastructure finance - witness its decision to sign up to the AIIB and BRICS
Bank - and on the many issues being taken up in the BRICS and other forums.
This is, presumably, because it does not believe that those forums inherently
violate the principles that it believes OBOR, as currently structured, would
fail to uphold.

This is, frankly, the first time that I have felt that the Modi government has
taken a stand that the preceding government would have balked at doing. In
almost all cases, the Modi government foreign policy has been an extension of
Manmohan Singh's policies - which is entirely to its credit. Consistency in
such matters is the sign of a mature nation. But one of the errors that the
Singh government consistently made was to be extra-careful of Beijing's
sensitivities. It failed, in essence, to reap any reward for that attitude:
Beijing's foreign policy continued to be made with no thought of India's ""core
interests"". Consider, for example, climate change, where India signed up to
the Chinese agenda at the big conference of parties in Copenhagen during UPA-
II, only to find that Beijing went behind its back to sign a bilateral pact
with Washington on climate change a few years later. No doubt UPA-II would
also have learnt in time not to do so - but that does not take away any credit
from the Modi government for not being over-solicitous of Beijing's
sensitivities.

By taking the lead in questioning the basic rationale underlying OBOR, Modi
has done us proud. We should now ask, however: what next? A principled stand
on a conference is valuable in and of itself, but it needs to be followed up.

There are some obvious next moves. First, New Delhi must recognise that it is
essentially, by objecting to OBOR, standing up for liberal policies and
economics within various other countries. Thus India must now view itself as a
leader of a market-driven, liberal democratic bloc that wishes to create an
alternative view of the global economy to China's more authoritarian, state-
driven view. The latter is increasingly dominant, especially as Trump's
America turns its back on the world. We must stand up for market access, free
movement of capital goods and people, and liberal political principles
everywhere. This is both principled and in our real interests.

And second, we must work with the Japanese - our biggest partners in this
regard - to create connectivity belts that are not centred on China and which
serve our mutual strategic interests as well as not disrupting local countries
and economies the way OBOR might. Our cooperation with Japan - and Indonesia,
Singapore and Australia - must be taken to the next level.

Modi promised foreign policy leadership. For the first time, he is beginning
to deliver. He must keep going.

**Modi government: The next two years** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government completed three years in office last week. Any assessment of its economic performance should take into account what it inherited. India faced a near-crisis situation in 2013. Inflation had spun out of control. Public finances were a mess. The rupee was in free fall. Confidence was low owing to corruption scandals and economic mismanagement by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in the years leading to the 2014 general election.

India has come a long way since then. The most important economic policy achievement of the past three years has been macroeconomic stability. Inflation is now under control. There has been a tentative recovery in economic growth. The balance of payments is comfortable. Part of this can be explained by the steep decline in global energy prices, but the retreat from loose monetary and fiscal policies has also been an important reason why the Indian economy is no longer fragile.

The reforms record has been a more mixed one—especially since Modi spoke on the campaign trail about minimum government and maximum governance.

The Modi government should be satisfied that the stage is now set for the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST). Even the flawed GST we are beginning with will boost overall efficiency in the economy. India now has a new monetary policy framework. The passage of the bankruptcy code will lead to more efficient allocation of capital. However, these policy initiatives were inherited from the UPA regime. The Modi government needs to now craft its own reforms playbook for the next decade.

There have been some important initiatives. A new fiscal framework is in the works. High-level corruption has almost disappeared. The auction of natural resources has been done in a transparent manner. The government has also taken a number of steps to check the flow of black money. However, the most radical move made by the Modi government was the withdrawal of high-value banknotes in November 2016. The benefits of the move are not yet clear, and will only be known in the years ahead.

The government has managed to bring down the fiscal deficit while increasing capital expenditure. A recent report by Deutsche Bank showed that government expenditure led by capital expenditure increased in the last two years of the term of every government since 1991, with the exception of UPA-II, when expenditure went up in the last year. However, barring UPA-I, higher expenditure did not result in a corresponding increase in the fiscal deficit. It will be important for the Modi government to stick to the stated fiscal path, and not indulge in a spending spree like the UPA, as it could compromise the hard-won macroeconomic stability.

Along with maintaining fiscal discipline, the government will have to continue to work in areas that are holding back the economy. One of the reasons why growth has remained subdued in the last few years is the collapse in private sector investment. Policymakers have not been able to solve the twin balance sheet problem. A coherent strategy to clean up banks is still not in evidence. Privatization of public sector banks should be seriously considered.

Also, all efforts should be made to strengthen the corporate bond market in order to channelize long-term finance for Indian companies. This will also help boost activity in the infrastructure sector where private sector investment has been missing, partly because of the reluctance of banks to lend. An investment revival is critical for higher growth.

The government should now work on the next level of reforms. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government managed to do a lot of things in the latter half of its tenure. For instance, the fiscal responsibility and budget management rules and pension reforms were implemented towards the end of its tenure. The looming political risk is that the job creation needed to maintain social stability cannot be addressed without reforms in factor markets. The complex web of laws does not allow enterprises to grow. The next level of reforms should simplify laws in the land and labour markets, which will significantly improve the ease of doing business in the country.

Finally, Modi should know by now that India is being held back by inadequate state capacity. The government does too much in some areas; and it does too little in others. It needs to build capabilities to manage the fastest growing large economy in the world—but not fall into the interventionist trap that it so often seems to be doing these days.

Recent history has clearly demonstrated that economic growth is the best solution for poverty alleviation and improving standards of living. Therefore, the challenge for the Modi government would be to take the Indian economy to a sustainable high growth path. And the next two years will be as important, if not more so, than the past three years.

Thus a lot of daily hurdles that the Indian government has, the Chinese don't.

Looking so far back as the British is of no use. In 1960 India was doing better than China on all parameters. Technological dominance came later.

The government of India is in overdrive to promote digital payments in a country that is excessively dependent on cash with one of the highest cash to gross domestic product ratios in the world. Niti Aayog has proposed an award scheme to incentivize people to use digital modes of payments. Last week, the government announced several measures—such as discounts at petrol pumps and on rail tickets, and insurance policies sold by public sector insurance companies—to boost digital transactions.

There is indeed merit in reducing the usage of cash in the economy as electronic transactions, among other things, leave a trail and make tax avoidance more difficult. However, moving towards a more cashless society is a medium-to-long term goal. The government’s present urgency to turn the ongoing currency swap into a major push to make India a cashless economy must be seen keeping this in mind.

ALSO READ | Watal panel moots independent payments regulator

To be sure, the narrative of the currency exchange programme has changed significantly in the last one month. It was conceived and launched as an attack on black money and counterfeiting of currency notes, but the objective now seems to have shifted to making India a cashless economy. This newspaper supported the idea of the currency swap as part of a bouquet of policies against tax evaders. It was clear from the word go that this would only attack a part of the stock of black money that is stored in cash. But the incoming evidence suggests that many tax evaders have actually managed to launder their illicit wealth. A large number of new bank notes being recovered by the authorities in various parts of the country and a massive surge in deposits in Jan-Dhan accounts are cases in point. Clearly, the implementation of the currency exchange has left much to be desired. Effectiveness of policy also depends on implementation; ideas alone don’t lead to desired outcomes.

It now appears that the amount of currency notes that will not return to the banking system was overestimated. This perhaps explains the pivot to the cashless theme. As Praveen Chakravarty of IDFC Institute highlighted in these pages on Monday, Prime Minister Narender Modi mentioned “black money” 18 times in his initial speech on 8 November and did not talk about cashless or digital economy. However, in two speeches that he gave on 27 November, he mentioned “cashless” and/or “digital” 24 times, but black money came in only nine times. The excessive amount of time being taken to replace the currency notes and persistent queues in front of banks and ATMs may also have prompted the government to push for digital transactions.

ALSO READ | Regulating the digital payment industry

However, the government would be well-advised to not depict the transition to a more cashless economy as the main objective behind the currency reform. The overwhelming public support that the government got after the withdrawal of high-value notes was for the attack on black money and not for making transactions cashless.

Reducing the role of cash in the system is a worthy goal, but it cannot be the driving force for this policy as it now appears to have become. As noted in this editorial, the move towards a more cashless system is a longer-term goal. There are practical problems on the way. A vast majority of Indians either don’t have bank accounts or the technological wherewithal to make or receive digital payments. Many of them belong to the same aspirational middle and neo-middle class that supported the move as an attack on black money and corruption.

Furthermore, digitization alone will not justify the political and economic risk attached to the currency swap. The latest high-frequency economic indicators such as auto sales and Purchasing Managers’ Index for both services and manufacturing shows that economic activity has been affected, though the actual overall impact will only be known in the coming months. In terms of the political impact, the renewed friction between the government and the opposition has resulted in almost the entire winter session of Parliament being wasted, and it now appears that meeting the 1 April deadline for the implementation of the goods and services tax will be extremely difficult.

Since the government has taken a big political risk, it should avoid moving the goalposts. Changing the narrative of the currency swap could affect the government’s credibility and make it more difficult to take tough decisions. It will be a long-drawn-out battle against black money and action will be required on various fronts. Not all of it will be successful.

New Delhi: Finance minister Arun Jaitley is likely to significantly increase public investment in infrastructure in Union Budget 2017, offering fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth at a time when private investment shows no signs of a pick-up.

There is near unanimity that the economy needs to be spurred through higher public investment, unlike last year when there was a significant divergence of opinion over the need for fiscal stimulus, said an official with knowledge of the thinking within the government. The official requested anonymity.

Last year, chief economic adviser in the finance ministry Arvind Subramanian advocated a stimulus, but the minister decided to stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), fearing a backlash from investors and rating agencies.

“Different schools of thought have argued either in favour of fiscal consolidation and stability or for a less aggressive consolidation and for boosting growth. I have weighed the policy options and decided that prudence lies in adhering to the fiscal targets,” Jaitley said in his budget speech last year.

ALSO READ | Union budget: Good economics, good politics, or bit of both?

This year, the economic context in which the budget will be presented on 1 February is different.

Investment demand in the economy is expected to contract in 2016-17 by 0.2% from 3.9% growth in 2015-16, according to data released by the government’s statistics department earlier this month.

The investment scenario further worsened after 8 November when the government invalidated high-value currency notes. Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt Ltd (CMIE) data released earlier this month showed a sharp fall in new investment proposals in the October-December quarter to Rs1.25 trillion, compared with an average of Rs2.36 trillion worth of new investments seen per quarter in the preceding nine quarters that the Narendra Modi government has been in power.

Clearly, investors have been spooked.

D.K. Srivastava, chief policy adviser at EY India, said the economy needs a “substantial fiscal stimulus” to revive growth, which had started slowing even before demonetization. “Government can revise upward its fiscal deficit target for next fiscal to 3.5% of GDP from 3% of GDP under the existing fiscal consolidation roadmap. Beyond that it can allow states to borrow more for capital investments.”

ALSO READ | Should the budget stray from straight and narrow path of fiscal consolidation?

The government may be helped by the recommendations of a committee set up under former secretary in the finance ministry and Bharatiya Janata Party member N.K. Singh to suggest a new roadmap for fiscal consolidation. The committee, which was appointed in May last year, was asked by the finance ministry to examine the need and feasibility of aligning fiscal expansion or contraction with credit contraction or expansion, respectively, in the economy. It has also been asked to examine the feasibility a “fiscal deficit range” . The committee is expected to submit its report on Thursday.

The government official cited earlier said one of the key reasons behind advancing the budget presentation by a month is to give more time to key infrastructure departments such as railways, highways and urban development to implement larger projects as more funds will be made available to them.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month told economists at the NITI Aayog that advancing the date of presentation of the Union budget will help speed up investment expenditure in the productive pre-monsoon months.

I don't think any govt is going to fuck with that. Diplomatic relations are built upon years of work by diplomats staying in those countries. So why try to fix something that is not even broken and would take a lot of time.

Russia is also not in any better condition. USA at least have businesses that provide work to Indian companies. Russia's economy is shrinking and they have put in a lot in Syria.

In 2014, a slow year for the Indian economy, India grew at a rate of somewhere around 5%. (Estimates vary from 7-4.x, so 5% is a reasonable middle of the ground number.) 

This meant an addition to Indian GDP of about 100 billion dollars. In comparison, Pakistan has an economy of around 245 billion dollars.

So in a bad year, India will add to its economy half a Pakistan, and in a good year, India will add to its economy one full Pakistan. In a decade or two, the relative economic disparity between India and Pak, which is at 10:1 today, will be around 20:1.

But OTOH, I have to admit that overall he was better than 99% of the other options at that time - his personal stature imbued the PMO with a sense of dignity, he was pretty good as a figurehead - he could speak well and if he had left governance to the officials and confined himself to the ceremonial role, I think he would have been remembered well.

* **Shastri**: [7/10]: Bit of a surprise package. During his early days in office, he'd kept a pretty low profile, almost like late-term MNS. But he rose to the occasion in 1965, when confronted with Pak's Op Grand Slam.  He authorized the military to open a second front - a decisive move that helped India militarily and restored some of the confidence lost in 1962, both among the services and the civilian population

* **Desai**: [1/10]: Fucking disaster. Disgrace to the office of the PM

* **Charan Singh**: N/A: Nonentity but at least not an idiot like Desai

* **Indira Gandhi**: [6/10]: Probably the most divisive of India's PMs. A lot of people overlook that her two terms were very different - her second term was much more low-profile than the 1st one. But overall, she made many mistakes. The emergency of course, but also her nationalization drive (consummating India's flirtation with socialism started by her dad) and her overt political dealings. (FWIW, I don't think her political machinations were any worse than the others', she just carried them out more openly, and broadened her scope of influence, opening the door to other politicians doing the same). She also handled the Khalistan situation badly - Op Blue Star... well, that was a crying shame. On the flip side, she was the most decisive PM India has had - she knew when to get out of the way and let the professionals do their job. India's profile rose with the Asian games, CHOGM and other events on her watch. Most importantly, she handled 1971 perfectly - a lot of folks don't understand *how* badly it could have ended for India, given the US position and the localized issues in Bangladesh, Punjab and Pakistan. That the country came out on top is nothing short of incredible

* **Rajiv**: [4/10]: Pretty much a nonentity, wasted years for India.

* **VP Singh**: [2/10]: Mandal and other BS

* **Gujral**: [3/10]: Personal probity aside, his Gujral doctrine was a fucking mess. Still, at least he had some ideas, shitty though they were My top 3 in chornological order - ( Shastri had too short a stint to know for sure) 

1- Nehru - Made huge mistakes but setup the way things work in India. We have adjusted some minor things but Indian economy's most important features work the way his team designed- Socialist 5 yr Planning, Non-aligned diplomacy, federal structure where center is all powerful, central institutions of great quality like AIIMS, IIT, IIM 

There is no major change apart from liberalization in 1992 that any PM has done to the precedents laid out by him.

2- PV Narsimha Rao - Gave all of us McDonalds and private sector jobs. Without him liberalizing economy, we would be the at least 20-30% poorer as a nation and individually. 

3-  AB Vajpayee - Made major changes to the way India was conducting diplomacy and re-started the process of structural changes PVNR had brought in.  Was Shastri instrumental in anything other than winning the Pak war. Yes, that is a big one, but I have heard people being so impressed with Lal Bahadur Shastri, that I want to know what else did he do? 1. Indira Gandhi (8/10): Split Pakistan into two pieces...this victory is the greatest Indian victory since the Marathas defeated the Mughals. Also, she convinced the Sikhs that an independent country in northwestern India will not even be discussed.  Can you imagine how horrible it would be to have a country that plays Pak and India against each other and shelters agents from both sides?

2. Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, VP Singh, Chandra Shekar, IK Gujral, HD Deve Gowda (7/10). These prime ministers proved that India was not a Single-Party state. They provided the first viable opposition to Congress and showed that whoever wins an election in India will peacefully take power. Also, these Janata Dal governments were among the first to have leaders from Middle-Caste and Lower-Middle Castes...this integrated these communities into democratic India by assuring them that India belonged to them too. Deve Gowda is especially important because he assured non-Brahmin dravidians that India would not treat them like 2nd Class citizens. 

3. Atal Bihari Vajpayee (6.99/10) for improving the budged deficit, undertaking infrastructure projects and for establishing a permanent and resilient opposition party. 

4. PV Narasimha Rao (6.98/10) for liberalizing the economy. Also he was the first non-Nehru dynasty person to serve a 5 year term. This is why his memory is erased in the Congress party...they don't want to acknowledge that the Congress can thrive without the Family. 

5. Manmohan Singh (4/10). For making India enter into some nice nuclear deals. Also, though he was largely a figurehead, at least he made sure an Italian didn't become PM. It would have been might embarrassing for a country known for anti-imperialism to be ruled voluntarily by a European. I know Sonia largely (but not completely) ran the show behind the scenes but still symbolism is important and I'm glad Manmohan was the PM representing India overseas. 

6. The rest were not really consequential positive or negative. 



 Nehru: 8/10. Passed the Hindu bills in spite of opposition from almost all pro Hindu organizations. If not for him Hindus today would have been in same state as Muslims. His relationship with Edwina Mountbatten helped India a lot in partition. Sure he erred on Kashmir but Kashmir anyway could have gone either ways. He is the reason we have democracy. While almost every post colonial democracy failed, India thrived because of him. He actually believed in democracy. Had he died 5-10 years earlier, India would surely have lapsed into dictatorship. His economic philosophies were alright for his times but were carried on for long because of his family being in power. 

Atal Bihari Vajpayee: 7/10. Mistake on Kargil but India coped well. Went big on infrastructure, the best thing to happen. Very few scams during his time compared to any other PM.

Narsimha Rao: 6/10 Started liberalization and helped India break from stagnation.

Shastri: 5/10 Led India well, clean image. Had promise.

Indira Gandhi: 4/10 Emergency and some extreme socialist decision notwithstanding she did well in operation Bluestar and 71 war.

Rajiv Gandhi/Manmohan Singh: -5/10 Took India years back.

Everyone else: 0 they were just holding onto their chair. Confession: I don't know much about PMs before Rajeev, other than Indira. Hence, my rankings:


1. AB Vajpayee (1999-2004) - True globalization. Stable economy, low inflation. Honorable foreign policy, good handling of Kargil. 

2. PV Narasimha Rao (1991-1996) - Good handling of BoP crisis. Tried to make a break from Gandhi Dynasty.

The rest are worthy of contempt:

Negative 1,000,000 - Indira Gandhi (1966-1984) - Started India's love affair with all that's evil today, from sloth and corruption to ineptitude and greed. India's Hitler and Castro rolled into one. May she rot in hell.

Negative 1000 - Rajiv Gandhi (1984-1989) - Perpetuated Momma's stupidities, fine tuned vote bank politics, first PM level corruption.

Negative 500 - Dr Manmohan Singh (2004-) - Took India from ""growing economy"" to ""stagnated economy"" and now disaster story

Negative 500 - VP Singh (1989-1990) - Mandal Commission, indecisive on key policy points

The rest (post Rajeev) are idiots. 1. Narasimha Rao
2. Vajpayee 


3. Manmohan Singh (UPA 1 only)
4. Lal Bahadur shastri (just for winning the war)
 gujral missing in the list?! Shastri - Best Ever
Indira Gandhi - Strong leader..though misuse of power but stability
AB VP - Nuff Said
Nehru - Guided through nascent democracy years
PV N - Filled the void in bringing open markets
VP - Alternative
RG - Unable to use absolute majority to guide india and set up as a success
MMS - Do I even type
Moraji Desai - Opened can of worms of bad governments
Charan Singh - Why was he PM
Nanda - Filler...served his purpose
Deve Gowda - Classic example of what is wrong with Indian electoral system
Chandra Shekar - If there is a way to make this unhappen, please look into it. ModiAll others I don't know PMs before ABVP, so my order is short:

1. Vajpayee
2. Manmohan Singh

Narasimha Rao

796,Policy/Economy,"I am not economist.Current GDP growth estimate by IMF is 4.7% some say actual was 3.5% while CPI inflation is 11.5 %. Indian economy is in total mess if they fail to fix it, it may have similar effect like Argentina. Fast growing China has inflation of 3%  UPA-1 did achieve some good economic figures.
It consequently won.. 

What we should truly evaluate is UPA-2?

I guess the figures would be very different. 



 This is a stupid way of presenting data. Why don't you just show the trend line? These tables are highly prone to misinterpretations. For example, UPA is a 10-year time period vs BJP, a 5 year time period. Best year GDP growth of 9.6 in UPA might be in 2004/2005/2006...which has absolutely no relevance to the disaster that UPA-II is today. It is very much possible that UPA-I reaped the benefits of BJP's policies. 

TL;DR: Just show us the trendline instead of cherry picking data. UPA I reaped the good sowing of NDA..UPA II is reaping the bad sowing of UPA I. In the NDA years, GDP growth was increasing, while in the UPA years, GDP growth turned negative. When NDA started their term, GDP was near 4-5% growth rate, when they ended, GDP growth was at 8.1%. When UPA started their term, GDP growth was at 8.x%, it peaked at 9% and is now down back to 4-5%. UPA-1 inherited a healthy economy from NDA. It was a ride while it lasted. 

UPA-2 suffered because of UPA-1.   So, effectively, UPA managed to magically turn every single rising graph into a falling graph. Spectacular. 

http://planningcommission.nic.in/data/datatable/1612/table_2.pdf 

In 1997-98 (Non NDA Gov), the GDP was 4.2%

NDA boosted it 8.3% by 2003-04. This momentum was maintained in UPA 1 tenure [but later it you see the graph is moving downward.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/india/gdp-growth-annual) 

In 1998, Infaltion was at 8.26%, by 2004 NDA brought it down to 2.80%. But UPA 1 boosted inflation to 8.70% by 2009 itself!

UPA has been in office for 123 months now and the number of months for which the food inflation stayed above 10% is 78. Thats almost 63% of their total tenure.

Comparing to NDA, they lasted for 72 months, in which the food inflation stayed above 10% only for about 12 months i.e 17% of their tenure. 

Now, i don't know about food prices and other commodity prices, but they surely gone up by 90-900% since the UPA regime took over.

Talking about Fiscal deficit, it was -6.29 in 1998-99, NDA reduced it to -3.88 by 2004. However post 2004, fiscal deficit kept on increasing and now its stands at - 5.15.


 [NDA had current account surplus in 2002, 2003, 2004 \(Again as per above links\). The current account deficit was -2 in 1998. NDA did a nice job and brought it to +2.3 in 2004 which UPA reduced to -5.15 at present. 
](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/india/current-account)

Regarding jobs, NDA created ~61 million jobs, however UPA 1 could only managed to create 2.7million.

 
Also the savings rate was increased from 23.19% in 1998-99 to 32.41 by 2004. Now its 30.81. 

Regarding exchange rate, the depreciation was of 9% during NDA tenure. Its more than 35% during UPA tenure. 

And lastly, the above data of  showing average scores is basically to fool the voters. We were not hit hard by any recession (and this is not i am saying. It was said by Dr. Singh himself). 

Sources: Mostly from tradingeconomics.com, RBI, Nassco, planning commission, Livemint claim check.  
 Inflation, price rise and massive unemployment neutralized most of the UPA's GDP growth rate and prevented it from actually reaching the people. Try this for perspective.

IMO, FSB is a good bill, passed at the wrong time. OP, you have spent your time writing stuff up - educating people and sharing something you believe in and that itself is commendable. 

Most people don't even know the basics of economy - so this post could be a good starting point for further discussions. I saw somebody calling you out as a socialist - and that shows how under-educated even our elite is(assuming those on /r/india are elites). You could perhaps expand more on why our government decided to spend a large amount of cash on welfare policies and compare the same with few first world nations. 

Personally, I believe govt should just focus on governing and the rest should be left to the economy. They do a bad job at everything they touch so policies like National Corruption Guarantee Scheme are bound to fail in India. But even while I say that, the policies themselves are not that bad. Guaranteed employment, food, education etc are all very good and noble ideas. Hopefully, someday we will have a stronger economy to implement these ideas well.  Does it mean that if a lot of people stop using cars value of Rupee may go up?

Also good work OP. I think it's a combination of both the export/import gap as explained, but also the result of economic slowdown in India and continued questions about India's fiscal responsibilities.

______



  
 
  
  Whether demonetization will eliminate the shadow economy remains unclear but it has definitely cast a long shadow on the government's budget and the discussions surrounding it.



 
In his budget speech today, the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley defended the demonetization policy of the government as a bold measure against tax evasion, claiming that it will lead to a GDP that is ""bigger, cleaner, and real"".



 
Yesterday, for the third year in a row, Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian produced an impressive Economic Survey document. It provides a refreshing break from the narrative coming from the all-izz-well corner of economic commentators who feel critics are just cockeyed naysayers. Also, unlike most government documents, far from being yawn-inspiring, it is actually interesting to read - that in itself is an achievement. After all, when was the last time a government document on a dry topic like monetary policy began with a quote like ""Taka mati, mati taka"" (""Money is like soil, soil is like money"") by Sri Ramakrishna Paramhamsa!  
  
  



Show Full Article

 
Now, given the current economic scenario following demonetization, a more appropriate Sri Ramakrishna quote might have been the more reassuring ""Bhoy ki re pagol, ami to achhi! (Don't be afraid, crazy child, I am here)"". However, given the virtual absence of the CEA and the Governor of the RBI from the public domain ever since the misguided demonetization policy was unleashed on the economy, the choice of the quotation may indeed be apt.

 
 

 
As many including I have argued, the demonetization policy that indeed converted 86% of currency notes into soil, was deeply flawed in theory, and its implementation and the many flip-flops in the rules is a textbook example of administrative bungling. The stated objectives have shifted from a one-time tax on black wealth to curbing counterfeit money to cutting off finance for terrorists to accelerating the move to a digital economy to, as of yesterday, making real estate cheaper. None of this holds up to scrutiny - almost all the old notes have been deposited back in banks, and the new notes have proved to be as popular with counterfeiters as well as terrorists.

 
 

 
And to say such a policy is going to accelerate the move to a digital economy is like saying if we close down all retail shops from tomorrow, everyone is going to order online. Yes, that may be the way of the future, and may be true of those who are on the right side of the digital divide, but as of now, not more than a quarter of Indians have smartphones and a similar percentage have access to the internet.

 
 

 
The Economic Survey is right in saying that real estate prices may have fallen as a result of this policy. But this was not a stated objective; and even if it was the objective, it stretches credulity to make the case that to achieve this, the best policy is to withdraw 86% of the country's money supply! One might as well be talking about reducing the spread of skin-disease given how dirty some of the old notes were!



 
Talking about the dirtiness of old notes, the Economic Survey does come up with an interesting, though admittedly imperfect, way of measuring the extent of black money. They use data on ""soil rates"", that is, the rate at which notes are considered to be too damaged to use and have been returned to the central bank. Using the logic that if the notes were actually being used for transactions, as opposed to being stored as wealth, they would probably be getting dirty or damaged quicker, from the data on soil rates they estimate the amount of cash not used for transactions, and hence potentially black, to be 3 lakh crore, which represents about 2 percent of GDP. 



 
Even if this estimate is true, given that almost all the old notes have been returned, contrary to what the government initially expected, was it worth inflicting a negative shock to the economy that pushed the growth rate down? The Economic Survey estimates the short-term of impact of this policy in terms of a fall in the growth rate of real GDP to be a quarter to a half percentage point, while the IMF estimates this to be a one percentage point drop. Moreover, these are likely to be significant underestimates. Field reports suggest that the extent of decrease in wholesale trade in the informal sector is to the tune of 20-30%, and the reason it is not captured in the projected growth rate for 2016-17 of 6.5% is because the unorganized sector data is not directly captured in the calculation, as the report itself acknowledges. Rather, this sector's contribution is assumed to be in proportion to that in the organized sector, and yet following demonetization, the growth rates of the two sectors are no longer linked.



 
It is true that the Indian economy will recover in the medium run, as the Finance Minister's speech and the report suggests. Major economies like that of India do recover after shocks. After all, even the great US recession that started in the early months of 2008 officially ended in the second quarter of 2009. The question remains, was it worth it? 



 
This debacle did more than earn the dubious distinction of the biggest policy-induced recession in history. We should not forget the direct costs of this policy in terms of hardship and pushing the poorer sections in the informal sector over the edge. By all accounts, the informal sector - which is normally the most cash-reliant part of the economy - has been particularly hard-hit. 



 
All discussions of one or a half percentage point's temporary dip in the growth rate seem to ignore a very basic point: in a highly unequal economy, even if the incomes of the poorer sections go down by a non-negligible percentage, the reduction in overall national income will be minor if the incomes of the rich are not affected very much. Consider an example: suppose there are 90 individuals earning Rs 1 and 10 individuals earning Rs 100 each, which gives a total income of Rs 1,090. If the income of the poor goes down by 20%, but the income of the rich is unchanged, overall income will go down by only 1.6%. Therefore, statements like ""It's only a percentage point in the growth rate"" or ""the economy will surely recover"" offer little comfort to those informal sector workers who had to head back to their villages because of the job losses caused by demonetization.



 
And the irony is that while the Modi government has treated MGNREGA with some disdain in the past, it is MGNREGA that has come to the rescue of many of the unemployed informal sector workers who went back to their villages to look for work. Apparently, the uptake in MGNREGA has gone up significantly, the only upward trend in a season where most economic indicators have pointed southwards. No wonder, then, the stated budget allocation to MGNREGA increased to a record Rs 48,000 crore for 2017-18, from Rs 38,500 crore in 2016-17. This appears to be a large increase even in real terms, although questions have already cropped up about the true extent of the increase, with some arguing most of the increase has already taken place as a result of increased demand after demonetization. May be like Munnabhai, the Finance Minister had visions of Gandhiji prior to the budget. May be it is the forthcoming elections in UP. Or maybe it is the PM's indirect way of acknowledging the failure of the demonetization policy, since he earlier described MGNREGA as a symbol of the failure of the Nehru-Gandhi model. Whatever the reason, this is an act of Gandhigiri that should be praised.

Earlier this month in Japan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his government seeks to pursue economic policies that will make India “the most open economy in the world”. His statement was lost amid the domestic din following his controversial decision to pull high-value banknotes out of circulation.

Chinese President Xi Jinping made a similar point on the sidelines of a conference in Peru. He pledged to further open up the Chinese economy so that the benefits of economic integration were shared more widely. These parallel statements by the leaders of the two largest emerging economies come at a time when protectionist sentiment is gradually casting a long shadow in the developed world, especially after the election of Donald Trump as the next US president. Global trade by value has also been shrinking.

The backlash against globalization in several rich countries is because a growing numbers of voters there believe that free trade has harmed them, as jobs have moved to Asia. A robust debate is still under way among economists whether technology has been a bigger reason why median incomes have stagnated in these countries, but the dominant narrative blames free trade.

The situation in India and China is quite different. Millions have been pulled out of poverty because of the opportunities offered by globalization. Economist Branko Milanović has provided one of the most evocative visuals of what he has described as the greatest reshuffle in global incomes in the past three centuries. His elephant diagram shows that the two groups that have seen the most rapid rise in incomes in the two decades after 1988 are the few in the top income percentile (the global elite) and the hundreds of millions around the median income (mainly people from India and China).

This fact partly explains why leaders such as Modi and Xi are committing themselves to open economies even while Western countries that originally pushed for globalization are getting attracted to protectionism. Their middle class has been one of the undisputed beneficiaries of globalization, and hence has a strong interest in more economic integration with the rest of the world.

But what precisely does being the most open economy in the world entail? Modi did not provide any details. Trade policy has definitely become less restrictive since the advent of economic reforms: import tariffs that were once among the highest in the world have come down dramatically. The goal set by the initial reformers that average tariff levels should come down to East Asian levels has been met. There is no doubt that the old protectionist walls have been dismantled.

The trade-policy reforms over the past 25 years have also resulted in better trade outcomes. The trade/gross domestic product ratio has doubled. India, however, can never reach the levels of openness of a country such as Singapore because of its size. Smaller countries tend to have a higher trade ratio because their domestic markets aren’t big enough.

The record is less encouraging when it comes to trade in services, despite the success of the software services industry. Trade in services usually increases in tandem with prosperity, so India still has some distance to go. The other two indicators of openness are restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) and capital account controls. India has far fewer FDI restrictions, though some sectoral caps persist, but the experience of China shows that there is an umbilical link between higher FDI and more international trade.

India has also brought down most of its barriers to capital inflows, though there are still controls. The standard measure for capital account openness—the Chinn-Ito index—shows that India has far more controls on capital flows compared to its peers. The traditional view within the economic policy establishment has been that capital-account convertibility should be a gradual process, and deeply dependent on durable macroeconomic stability as well as a strong banking system. The Modi government has as yet shown no sign that it has broken with this convention.

India is definitely a far more open economy than it was before the economic reforms of 1991. Millions of Indians have benefitted from its integration with the global economy, though that has increased the income gap between those who could take advantage of globalization and those who could not. India and China should be important voices in the protection of the liberal international order—both through a more active role in global institutions and through domestic reform that advances the cause of global economic integration.

Should India and China stand up for globalization when its advocates are dwindling across the developed world? Tell us at views@livemint.com

Replying to Jairam Ramesh of Congress, who raised the issue of ensuring complete autonomy for the IITs, Javedekar said the HRD Ministry is not there on any board of IITs.

The government is already working on a scheme for financing higher education infrastructure needs, particularly research infrastructure requirements, he added.

I hope they do well. Thing I am afraid is that it might split the opposition vote and give Congress another win. One more term for Congress and I think we are doomed. Should give them one chance. Things couldn't be worse anyway Sooner or later he will have to open his mouth to voice his opinions on issues other than corruption and quite frankly he is a simpleton.

Lets hope he focuses completely on the corruption agenda, gets enough votes to be, at the very least, a strong enough voice as part of a coalition with any of the two parties and force them into implementing greater transparency measures and strong anti corruption laws.

Unfortunately this party will probably be very extreme in most things. ref: AH saying alcoholics should be hanged and ambivalence on separatist issues. This is silly. Now they will just split the anti-incumbency vote, which would have gone to the BJP, and let Congress win again. They have no source of funding and no agenda. Heck, they dont even have unity within their own group!! Only Kejriwal and his coterie may think contesting elections is a good idea. You cant win elections like this. They'd have done better if they had remained an NGO and campaigned against corrupt candidates by making the public more aware of who the right candidate is. Now the whole anti-corruption thing is going to fizzle out. I would really like to see them do well, but ""Power Corrupts"". Also, some of his comments on personal freedoms are disturbing.

Well they'll never be credible enough for me.With the maoist and the azadi douches supporters on their team,they can expect  nothing more than a middle finger salutes from me. Here, I was hoping parties like LokSatta would do better. You either need experienced personnel or intellectuals in your party to form a stable government once elected.

809,Policy/Economy,"Because unlike the occupy hipsters in the West, we've lived through welfare socialism and have seen the effects of economic liberalization.

 I'm socially on the left wing, but right wing when it comes to economics. I'm totally for a free market economy. I wish India would adopt the [Nordic model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model).  >Instead of moving towards mixed economy welfare states like Western Europe or Scandinavia, why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ?

Sorry but your understanding of economics seems to be flawed. India is a mixed economy - State and Private sector are involved in production and it is not a free market economy, but a heavily regulated economy in which the state intervenes to correct the natural equilibrium of demand & supply.

The model you are referring to is the Nordic model (Social Market Economy to use the technical term). In this the type of set up there is actually more free market than the crony free market of the US or other ""free market"" economies.

A Nordic model is one that is capitalistic but tempered by an implementation of Ordoliberalism which says markets are free, competition decides if companies thrive or fall BUT there will be regulation to ensure fair competition.

>why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ?

Who wants to move to a free market corpotocracy? What (and I generalise) a lot of young Indians want is labour law reforms, more transparent rule making while reducing discretionary nonsense that is the cornerstone of Indian bureaucracy right now, support for infrastructure and consequently letting the private sector do what it does best. Make money, create goods & services while creating jobs. Nobody says that we shouldn't invest tax money in poverty alleiviation programs or investing in infrastructure or run schools & hospitals or any such thing! What we want is an end to the Maai-Baap sarkaari model that the CONgress has imposed upon this nation for 50 years. A model in which the government uses hand-outs to control votes, while keeping the nation poor and dependant on the government for their daily bread & butter.

>Why do we want leaders like Narendra Modi to be like Ronald Regan or Hitler ? Wouldn't Franklin D Roosevelt be a better role model ? FDR took America out of one of the worst financial meltdowns in American history.

This is the second time I am seeing your admiration for FDR and not questioning that, but what do you understand of his policies?

Have you truly looked at Modi's economic philosophies? Till Kujliwala said crony capitalism, nobody ever accused Modi / Guj of crony capitalism. 

Anyways, back to the topic on hand,

FDR's key solutions to recovery were as follows,

* Recovery of the Agriculture sector
* Create jobs at stable wages (in reality though, wages dipped while the number of jobs created increased-check wages paid out via the WPA if you need clarity on this)
* Using a fiscal deficit (atleast in the 1st & 2nd New Deals) to fund the WPA to create infrastructure.
* Increased corporate taxation (it is another matter that this was absolutely watered down)

There are other Fiscal policies / Monetary policies which I will not discuss now as it is not relevant to the point I am trying to make below.

Look at Modi's Gujarat minus whatever blinkers you might have.

* The only state to have grown it's Primary (agriculture) sector at 10% plus, while the rest of the country grew at roughly 2%. While critics point out to other ""advanced states"" like Maha or TN and compare GDP growth rates, keep in mind the growth patterns of these states is NOT SUSTAINABLE. They have moved directly from a primary economy to a tertiary economy skipping entirely the manufacturing phase which is where jobs are created.

* As a net share - Manufacturing+Agriculture contribute roughly 60% of the states GDP, while in states like Maha and TN this would be at a paltry 35%. Keep in mind, nationally Agri+Manufacturing account for close to 70% of all employment.

* State with the LOWEST unemployment figures - The above thrust on the primary & secondary are paying off. Jobs are being created. Have real wages dipped? yes, but that is more of a function of demand & supply equilibirum and less of ""Evil Adani pays less hurr durr"". 

* Taxation in Guj (despite all accusations of crony capitalism aside) has increased, it has the highest contribution of tax revenue as a percentage of total revenue is at 80% which is the highest in the country! Clearly, all that free land is paying off in the form of increased state taxes.

How does any of the above equate to crony capitalism? Why would a crony capitalist develop the primary sectory where 60% of our population works? If anything, thrust on the agricultural sector+increased job creation+increased taxation were aside from the fiscal tweakings a corner stone of FDR's New Deal.

Truly you seem to be spouting the same gibberish less informed people spout, you might want to look at the macro economic indicators before you come to any conclusions.

Not every Chaddi wearing Sanghi is a brain dead communalist, some of us have decided to vote for him more because of his economic policies and not for whatever else people vote for him.

>I think a bloated bureaucratic license raj is as bad as a business oligarchy like Russia or any of the South American countries. Why do people want to move from one corrupt system to another ?

Really? Simply take a list of the big name MNC's and Indian manufacturing powerhouses operating out of Guj and Adani / Ambani would be just one amongst the Fords, Samsungs, Peugeots, Renaults, Lakshmi Steels, Mahindra's, Tata's etc etc. It is sad that off all the bad things Kujliwala has done, he has used his goodwill in convincing people that Modi's gujarat supports crony capitalism! Not much original thought in this. Essentially your entire question = ""they are doing, why aren't we?""

>Outside of sources like Fox news, western media is deeply cynical of unregulated capitalism - especially after the global financial crisis of 2007-8. The same general idea is reflected in the educated youth/college grads in the developed world too.

Neither the media, nor the students, are contributing to their nations' growth.

>Why does India have the complete opposite attitude towards economics ?

Because it's required. The kids joining International Socialist Organization live in first world countries that can afford unemployment benefits.

>Instead of moving towards mixed economy welfare states like Western Europe or Scandinavia, why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ?

Because we have the largest number of extremely poor people. We need to make money to feed them.

>Why do we want leaders like Narendra Modi to be like Ronald Regan or Hitler ? Wouldn't Franklin D Roosevelt be a better role model ? FDR took America out of one of the worst financial meltdowns in American history.

Ronald Reagan was one man's comparison. In any case, all American presidents have sworn by free enterprise, it's only their socialism that has varied in degrees. Modi is pro-welfare too, just not a welfare state to the exclusion or detriment of private enterprise.

>Is it just an overextension after years of misrule under the Congress party ? I don't want to believe that Indians are inherently more selfish than everybody else.

Selfish is a good thing. We want to make money. We want to pay taxes. We want the poor to be helped, but don't hold us back from our own destinies.

>I think a bloated bureaucratic license raj is as bad as a business oligarchy like Russia or any of the South American countries. Why do people want to move from one corrupt system to another ?
Personally I doubt there will be any major change in economic or foreign policy no matter who comes to power, but the mentality of India's urban educated youth is interesting.

Meh. Your p.o.v is too popular and stopped being relevant after the BOP crisis.

**India has no option. If not Modi, then someone from the economic right.** I believe it is mostly due to a false sense of entitlement and upbringing, The fact that you have had a decent life and have never had to live through abject poverty leads to apathy towards the underprivileged. So you tend to root for policies that will benefit your current standing, which in case of educated young Indians are the right wing policies. Because America and the west have strayed in too much to the right. We have strayed on too much to the left. You're comparing two different things. On the political scale, I am a left-social libertarian. Economically, I am liberal but to an extent. I believe in laissez-faire capitalism but with government oversight and regulation to prevent monopolies, pollution, and gouging customers. Essentially, rules that would apply to an individual to ensure the harmonious functioning of society, should apply to a corporation as well.

Now if the economic climate is way to the right of me, I would look like I am on the left of the spectrum. In an economic climate that is way to the left of me, I would look like I am on the right of the spectrum.

The first case applies to the US. I have been here since '99. I think the economic policies are pretty much brain-dead and have gone too far to the right. Intense deregulation is what led to the financial crisis of '08. Corporations have way too much power, and you essentially have state-sanctioned monopoly ensured by the revolving door between corporations and Washington (current head of FCC used to work for Comcast for example). 

In India, you have the other extreme. Far-left policies and the disastrous experimentation with Fabian socialism have stunted the economy and slowed down development. The Indian economy is comparatively hostile to entrepreneurship, although the situation is way better than it was, say 20 years ago. In fact, it was a combination of Nehru's and Indira's policies that brought India to the brink of bankruptcy in '89/'90, and it was only because of liberalization at that point that India's economy was saved. The additional liberalization during the NDA years also helped.

So this, in short, is why I favor regulation in the US, but deregulation in India. What India needs to do is learn from the mistakes the US made and not go too far in that direction. Because India is too far to the left economically relative to the US. You can't equate the current right wing of US with anything. According to their principles even their past governments would have been considered liberal. **Attention!** Please keep in mind that the OP of this thread has chosen to mark this post with the **[R]eddiquette Enforced** tag.

This is essentially the biggest criticism of capitalism. If you have analysed financial crises you will see only one pattern - no two crises are similar. You know why? Because after every crisis we learn a new thing about how economy can go wrong. In the 2007-08, Wall Street didn't understand the risks of what they were doing completely. Now we have better sense and hence are trying to implement Basel-3. I'm sure there will be more crises and each time we will learn a new thing.

India’s policies are being crafted to help strengthen its competitive advantage in a globalizing world. But what happens if the basis of that globalization changes? The UK’s recent decision to exit the European Union—popularly termed Brexit—has been touted as an indicator of the end of globalization. While we at the BCG Henderson Institute believe this view is rather extreme, our research concludes that the nature of globalization is indeed changing. In order to thrive in the next phase of globalization, India needs to act quickly—and differently.



Globalization of the past



India was a big beneficiary of the globalization phase, starting in the late 1980s, that led to rapid economic growth in emerging markets (EMs) on the back of outsourcing and trade. This phase witnessed the widespread adoption of the Internet, the outsourcing of low-cost manufacturing and services, and the development of globally integrated supply chains.



Consequently, India’s gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at a compound annual growth rate of 6.5% between 1990 and 2010, representing a significant improvement over the 4.3% average economic growth recorded between 1970 and 1990. Export of services to developed economies accounted for the bulk of this expansion, with the share of services jumping from 40.3% of GDP in 1980 to 45% in 1990, and to 55% in 2010. Services export growth almost quadrupled, from 4.5% during the 1980-90 period to 17.5% between 1990 and 2010. India’s integration with the global economy was made possible by the liberalization reforms initiated as a result of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) structural adjustment programmes in the early 1990s. Further, institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) which were set up to create uniform “rules of the game” enabled greater trade between countries.



This model of globalization prevalent since the late 1980s was, however, not unique. Our study of globalization, spanning the late 1800s to date, shows that globalization has phases of growth and periods of transition, usually triggered by a crisis event. Although each phase differs from the previous one, all of them follow the same model. This model comprises three forces (see below).



• First—a new “technology” (referred to in the broadest sense) was leveraged by a country or a set of countries to boost productivity and output.



• Second—one or more countries served as an economic “pole”, which became the global growth engine. Western European countries, the US and China played this role in the first, second and third phase of globalization, respectively, driving 20-25% of world GDP growth, and around 15% of the growth in global trade. This, in turn, fuelled economic activity in other countries, especially the trading partners of the “poles”.



• Third—a favourable system of global governance facilitated cross-border financial flows and trade through the enforcement of stable “rules of the game”.



Together, these forces have fostered a virtuous cycle of economic growth and greater global integration, ensuring that global economics took precedence over local politics.



However, our research shows that this model of globalization is unlikely to repeat itself. New, emerging technologies are expected to see fundamentally different adoption patterns from those seen in the previous waves. And, governance structures will undergo transformative changes, necessitating compliance with multiple, often conflicting, global rules.



Globalization: What next?



Technological disruption: While new digital “technologies” (robotics, digital services, global platforms) are emerging which are beginning to impact productivity, they will not be able to create the same virtuous cycle of rapid economic growth through trade of goods to create a new global growth pole. Unlike in the past, digital technologies are not “dominated” by one or few countries. This marks a major deviation from previous cycles, where countries such as the US and China leveraged their competitive advantages in mass manufacturing and low-cost production, respectively, to emerge as the world’s economic “pole”. Further, the adoption of digital technologies across various industries will result in more localized manufacturing and globalized services, giving rise to very different trade patterns. Additionally, rapid, large-scale replacement of old manufacturing technologies by newer, digital ones is unlikely, given the growing unavailability of enough skilled workers like robot programmers. Rising income inequality and the need to protect jobs could also bring in stringent regulations, slowing the adoption of disruptive technologies.



New governance structures: The stable “rules of the game” set by the Bretton Woods institutions and the Group of Seven nations are now changing, with the Group of 20 states playing an increasingly influential role. This is likely to create new winners and losers. In the previous phases of globalization, there was a fair degree of long-term alignment between economics and politics. Today, the WTO-governed free trade regime is making way for more bilateral and regional partnerships and possibly mega-regional and sub-regional trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, although the latter has been stalled. There is growing protectionism across both developed and emerging markets. The multilateral financial architecture is getting decentralized, with China and other prominent developing countries teaming up to establish new institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and New Development Bank (NDB). There is also growing influence of state capitalism on capital allocation worldwide, through multiple levers such as direct acquisition of private companies, investments via sovereign wealth funds, and loans and subsidies for the development of certain domestic industries.



The Fourth Wave of Globalization



These shifts in geopolitics, and the trade and financial architectures point to a growing divergence between economics and politics. This has the potential to create greater uncertainty and volatility, as well as a country-region centricity in decision-making, hindering global integration. The market is losing ground to the state and labour advantage is giving way to digital advantage. These trends are driving the emergence of a new model of globalization.



It is unlikely that export-led trade growth, a core feature of the old model, will continue to be the primary driver of GDP growth going forward. The new model will be different on all three key dimensions



Growth: The new model will see a shift away from the “pole” model of economic growth, and vocabulary of developed economies versus EMs, to that of a multipolar world. Countries will have varied growth trajectories, with many EMs becoming less reliant on exports and focusing more on boosting domestic demand. Meanwhile, developed economies and China are likely to grow through greater increases in productivity and de-bottlenecking of the economy through internal structural reforms.



●Technology: In the previous phase, global value chains were designed to be cost-optimized and relied on a dominant “technology” of low-cost manufacturing driven by labour cost advantage in emerging economies. In the next phase, these will give way to complex multi-technology value chains that blend digital technology with the earlier low-cost technologies. We will also see greater integration across products and services. Moreover, global platforms (for example, marketplaces like Amazon and Alibaba) are likely to assume increasing importance, as companies rely on these platforms for exchange of goods and services, rather than investing in their own asset-heavy supply chains.



Governance: The “rules of the game” will become more complex with the emergence of a multi-institutional governance architecture, wherein regional and local regulations will coexist alongside global rules, balancing national political interests with global multilateral economic agendas.



What does this mean for India?



New policies are currently being enacted that will allow India to build a global competitive advantage going forward. However, these policies are unlikely to yield maximum payoffs unless they can be reset for the next phase of globalization. The emerging fourth wave of globalization requires India to dramatically rethink its policy priorities for the next 15-20 years.

Original Post can be found on his Instagram handle : rathikrishna42 Is it really an incomplete end of the era? The man literally won everything there is to win in the game as captain, not even as just a player.

&#x200B;

Edit: A word Why do we expect the world from someone? He has achieved so so much but everyone will always talk about how in his last performance he didn’t do this or that. Sachin has to go through the same. Stop focusing on one thing and look at how far he has come in his career. Indians are just never happy, it’s sad. They do the same with their kids. At least give a credit who made this. Why did you crop his name. Downvoting as OP cropped out original creator 's name.. that's theft. Why do you have to keep reminding us :( Sigh..Does not matter how cool you are.. This will probably haunt him for years. I cannot imagine the plethora of emotions that would have been going through him since the start of that over. But, a big salute to one of the best captains and readers of the game, India has ever had. An incomplete picture at first because you cropped the artist name. Give credit where it’s due. This is quite unfair. He'll be remembered as a legend despite his last performance Lol, stop putting people on pedestals. Not incomplete and no end either. 

As a batsman he has slowed down in terms of power hitting but Pandya/ Pant will take over that front (which they should have in the semifinals). He is still as good a batsman you'll get for No 4/ 5, still a fast runner and lighting quick behind the wicket. Like for Federer it's the outsiders who are waiting for the retirement non-stop.

It is Ravi Shastri we need to bid goodbye to and move on. Some people move on Am I the only one who read 'DHOR' 🙆 No its not incomplete. He gave us Worldcup, worldcup 20 20, champion trophies, he is the most successful Indian criket captain in History. He is complete, his era is complete. He will deserve farewell like Sachin whenever he want to retire Its not the end. He will still play in T20 WC. Sorry I read it as Dhor first r/DesignPorn Incomplete? Bro which world are you living in? Or do you have amnesia. He has won everything that had to be won in cricket. Only captain with T20 World Cup, 50 Over World Cup & Champions Trophy. Pardon my language but fuck you for your stupid creative. It's because of ungrateful people who call themselves fans just like you that these cricketers are put under so much pressure to always perform. What have you done in your own uneventful life? Have you ever thought about that? Have you ever completed anything worthy for generations to come? You bro, are shit. There's little or no worth to your existence. I am no Dhoni fanboy but your creative is just dumb, tone deaf and utterly mistaken. Thoda jyada ho gaya [deleted] Wonderful creativity. *an era How you say incomplete Bar bar yaad mat dilao yr. Seriously guys there is no fairy tale ending in life. He got out doing what he did best and that is all that matters. People want everything to be a bollywood movie. I don't think that Dhoni has to rely on some armchair critic telling him how his career was incomplete. He has achieved a lot already. I have myself not been a huge fan of keeping him in the team for the past 6 months, but you have to be foolish to think his career is incomplete. Dhoni is not retiring.

He's not. Okay!? Out of the loop here. Can anyone tell me what exactly happened?

I didnt watch the world cup that's why. Thats how Karma bites you... [deleted] Why tf is everyone saying end of an era? He hasn't even slightly hinted at retiring anytime soon. Is this the doing of his haters? It’s not the end. He s gonna hang around Bhai rulaega kya?

Edit: PS. Found one reason. She goes on the cover of Cosmopolitan and also delivers a gold from a foreign city. Literally keeping her head in the game. I was thinking to go to her wiki page but Akshay Kumar will anyways make a movie on this in few months and sell desh bhakti . What's the latest on her controversy regarding testosterone levels? Is she one of those affected by the recent rulings regarding Caster Semenya? Proud feeling Proud of India I love the initiative of posting non-cricket news... kudos! Her coach told her, just before the race...


""New rule Dutee... If any of the big ones catch you, they are allowed to eat you... Have fun."" Anushka and virat is important bro.. Lesbians have to learn to run faster to save their lives from trishool fanatics Splitting sports on gender lines creates complexities like this. If any of her competitors were given testosterone in the amounts she naturally produces, during their puberty, they would probably blow her away.  Same issue with Castor from South Africa.

The question becomes, what is the relevance of being a female athlete when gender is fluid. Can we allow a very effeminate man who identifies as a woman to compete in women’s sports?

Recently there was some news about how top World Cup female soccer teams had been dominated by third tier men’s teams. This is another aspect of the absurdity. If women are insulated from competition from males, because males have unfair levels of testosterone, then shouldn’t they also be insulated from other individuals who have high testosterone regardless of those individual’s self declared gender identification?

Edit: look at that photo. Does it feel fair to arbitrarily allow someone with that much testosterone to compete with women who don’t have that advantage? And if we don’t split on testosterone lines, then why even have gendered sports? Doesn't she have XY chromosomes though? Unfair competition. Indian Athletics and any non Cricket sport deserves more publicity in India. But that said, I don't understand why r/India gets so excited about Indians winning in 3rd tier events in which the top athletes sit out. There are at least 10 women in the world under the age of 20 that can beat her time. And if she ran at the NCAA outdoor championships, she wouldn't even make it out of the prelims with her personal best. Her time of 11.24 would be good for 12th best.The university games are not even on the average American college athletes' radar. That's why these type of events get very little media coverage. I'm gay for her. But I'm a man. She is gay dutee chand. lol. what were her parents smoking before deciding on that name?

> Chinese government spends $46 billion on sports, while our budget allocation in sports is around $0.5 billion.

India needs massive infrastructure to train and support its athletes. Getting Olympic medals is a long term strategy, you can't just wake up one day and hope to win a medal. Just look at Mr. Bindra and the amount of time and money he invested to win his gold medal. We need world's top coaches to train our elite athletes, which needs $$$. China does not have 2 billion people, its population size is close to India at 1.3-1.5 billion, some countries have more registered professional athletes of certain sports despite having much smaller population than China and India. 

It comes down to the sport culture of a country, I'm guessing there are fewer registered athletes in India than Netherlands even, also check out the availability of sport facilities in India compared to other countries, I think it is also pretty low. 

Indians are not genetically inferior but I think religion is a great factor when it comes to nutrition, there are so many food taboos around in India that are stopping ordinary Indians from having balanced diet. Culture and history: Not many role models and viable career pathways hence low base  . The cliche of a billion people is just that a cliche without substance . Very few young people engage in sports, for starters need encourage kids to play but many schools don't have playgrounds .So parents are worried about kids future and discourage  them This topic was discussed just yesterday. [This](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/andrew.bernard/olymp60restat_finaljournalversion.pdf) famous paper found a strong association between Olympics medal tally and GDP, population size, ""host country effect"" and ""Olympics-oriented investment"" like in Soviet Union and China. China's advantage over India is its strong economy (5 times India's GDP) and an obsessive investment in sports. Apart from the many reasons listed already it's also about the cultural apathy towards any sport which we do not already dominate in. That apathy translates to exceptional athletes with medals practically begging for food after retirement. Govt does not provide enough after care to retired athletes and they are left to fend for themselves.

Would you want your child to sacrifice education for say a chance at volleyball if you know that most players have no future after the fact? Cause Indians don’t give a fuck about anything except cricket. Kyuki pesa lgta hai Like in real life democratic political system and govt has utterly failed to provide infrastructure for sports , promote it and provide facilities and support athletes . Its a combination of genetics, culture and GDP. In all these factors, India has the worst possible state.

1. Genetics: Indians on average are shorter and fatter than all races (maybe except East Asians). There is a study which shows that for the same BMI, Indians add on more fat than any other race. Needless to say, absorbing more fat for the same BMI is not a recipe for athleticism. 

2. Culture: The diet is horrible. Full of carbs (processed nowadays) and almost no protein. Nothing to do with income either, rich people also have the bad mix of macro nutrients. No culture of physical fitness. People think going to gym is only for bodybuilders.

3. GDP: $2000 per capita is 142 out of 200 countries. India is piss poor. Dont consider PPP here, top class sports equipment doesnt cost less in India. Small schools in the US have better facilities than elite sports clubs in India.

4. Olympics: Consider the types of competitions in Olympics. I would understand if there was 1 swimming event. Instead there are dozens of different combinations of swimming related events. This excludes most poor countries where swimming pools are a luxury. Equestrian events - need I explain? ",1561816455.0,0,34,0,76,,Why doesn’t India have more olympic medals or elite athletes

>Arthi Arun: I'm waiting for sponsors, till now no one approached me. I don't know why people ask me 'You're a doctor why do you need a sponsor?' Do you ask that to a cricketer? Sportspersons should be encouraged by giving sponsors so they concentrate on game&not financial burden. All the sports in India other than cricket deal with this because neither they are televised nor they are reported enough. Sponsorship depends upon popularity of sport which is very rare for weightlifting. You know every player's name of a cricket team but not the same with archery or any other sport. And to be real Sports Authority of India suck's the biggest! Well the sports authorities are busy attending the cricket World Cup so rest all sorts can wait. When participating in international events, is it possible to represent a neutral faction/body, instead of your own country? Because if the country doesn't care or appreciate efforts towards it, then sportspersons are better off representing something else. If it's not cricket then India doesn't care, it's sad but true. For a nation of over 1 billion people we should, purely statistically speaking, have way way more Olympians and medals.

Man that interview with Lalit Modi ( another Modi ha ha ) was funny af The episode is fine. But tbh he doesn't stress enough on the fact that why BCCI  does what it does. India being the most populous cricket playing nation, generates the most revenue. Naturally it would want the major chunk of it so that it could be used to distribute to the state cricket boards. This would only help in improving the facilities in the country. It might not be the most morally right thing to do but it also is not that wrong. It is a classic capitalist move. Just another recent case.. Australia and England were allowed to withdraw their players from the IPL for world cup prep. South Africa also wanted to do the same, but India blackmailed them with the cancelation of a tour after world cup. The big three at work again!

Ps. This is only a rumour and very few articles came out. But Ottis Gibson (coach of RSA) publicly said ""It would have been great had our players came back earlier"" and there were commentators who were talking about it at times too. But yeah, it is totally plausible. This is classic american mentality when they bully instituations for thier countries bennifits..its justified.. 

But when others do it it's curruption...

BCCI bully ICC becuase we supply major chunk of thier revenue. India gives cricketers arround the world opportunity and money. So ya BCCI have every right to be selfish and use thier leverage. BCCI use that money to improve stadiums and give more opportunities to young players.

I am not going to deny that BCCI doesn't have internal corruption but its no where near the level of past.. and after all the scandals in recent past BCCI has realised that its in thier best interest to stay out of politics... so i see no reason to be angry towards BCCI now.

It's like the Ikea of sportswear/clothing. Decathlon near my home organise events, from small walks for a cause to random cycling. Though a small town, it often has active participation of locals. 

Also, their staff are directly involved in these training activites, kinda makes the whole experience great. More than a shop, it gives a socialising platform in sports field. Thank you Decathlon, for once you are making arrogant sportswear makers like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Asics, NB nervous.  These people have made their products like 50 -100 % more expensive in India as compared to the west.  Largely making common products out of reach for the middle class.  

Nike shoes which are just common wear in the west is overpriced here and is supposed to be a fashion statement. So much so that when NRI travel to India they bring shoes as gifts to please my family. 

For context: A 100 $ Asics running shoe is  Rs14000 in India. What kind of business model is this? I'm going to decathlon for sure TIL Decathlon is French [deleted] Decalathon replaced my 4 month old shoes under warranty. :) 

Fuk u Adidas I don't know of anyone's been to decathlon's in Bangalore but somehow in all of them, the helper staff seem like well off upper middle class people in their 20s, you can tell from the way they speak and dress, their English is like those South Bombay kids. I have even seen foreigners work as staff. This is very weird because you don't see people who are well off doing jobs that are considered menial by a lot of people. Does decathlon pay really well or something. Reduced visits to Decathlon, because I end up spending more than I need to. The assortment is so good and the quality is first class.

I wish more brands adopt this style, I'm hopping IKEA has similar experience.

It may make little to no difference where your shorts or t-shirts are from, but if you're an active runner/player it's important to invest in the right pair of shoes or equipment.
Sure Decathlon is amazingly affordable, while nike is exorbitantly overpriced, but there are clear and significant reasons to also get nike.

837,Sports,"The main reason that esports hasn't flourished in India yet is because most of the older generation and people of younger generation who don't play games are not educated about the potential of esports and it's success in other countries. Parents would feel embarrassed and would not acknowledge it as a real job.

Second reason is that we Indians don't spend a lot of money, especially on luxury goods, and good PCs are luxury. Hence parents don't feel like it's worth spending money on an industry that they have no idea about and something that could be very volatile.

If we want esports to grow in India, we need to educate people about it. It was difficult in America itself to accept esports as a profession.

I listened to a really good podcast episode between The Esports Observer and Akshat Rathee from NODWIN Gaming where Akshat explains the esports scene in India and also explains why people cheat. It's a must listen for people interested in the esports scene in India. 

Here's the link: https://open.spotify.com/episode/28MfL8Mf8tlwIqvqnUPM15?si=FRP1PciSTuCXZaqJOm4BWQ Will only get bigger. It's inevitable. Danish PM playing with Astralis (considered best CSGO team ever) was just a PR move around their election time. That being said, a number of top-tier talents come from Nordic and Scandinavian region.

That being said, a career in esports is still not viable even outside, let alone here. If you're not a talent in a top org, bills become hard to pay. There have been many instances where talented people/ teams had to raise funds from the community itself. I don't know about other games, but Indian CSGO ""pros"" don't have the talent like the EU players. They are just way better. EU just owns.

Also to make big bucks, we ll have to invest time and money. Especially Esports. Also doing it unless you are absolutely sure? Investing thousands of hours practicing? Do you think the ""society"" will accept it? They ll just brand the guy ""addicted to gaming, gaming is bad, it should be banned"". Crosspost to r/indiangaming as well We need a break out star in a competitive game(like faker or sumail) so we can kick start more poeple in our country. We have teams but they are just so far behind international standards... But hopeful since we have so many tournaments now than compared to last decade... Unless people take gaming seriously nothing's gonna happen. Half of my friends didn't knew PUBG was a thing unless it hit the play store. I feel pathetic for people calling themselves gamers who play on mobile and despise PC gaming. ( My friends tease me for playing games on PC saying I have no life and shit and yet they play PUBG the whole day. )

Esports won't be a thing unless someone is ready to take flak head on from the Indian society. Our aunties and unkills who believe in doctor and engineer species only. I hope someone revives it.

In the few years I've seen some really great Indian born games on mobile gaming platform. They're not 10/10 but at least they're of the same quality we deserve compared to the western counterpart.

Recently our college was creating clubs. I wanted to make an Esports club badly but I realized 90% of my colleagues wouldn't know its meaning. The idea got buried. Even if I did manage to get the courage and tell my faculties I want an Esports club and explain them, I m pretty sure they'd laugh their ass off and forget about it next day. The general rat culture in our country does not provide a conducive environment for competitive games like Dota/CSGO to flourish.

We might have more players than Europe but the skill level is terrible I don't thing pubg mobile is going anywhere when it comes to esports. It's not precise enough cause touch screen for an event involving skill In my local area, a lot of gaming pubs host DOTA and CSGO tournaments.

But I believe it's gonna be a long while before esports becomes recognised over here. Give it another 10 years and it will become an Olympic Sport. First of all, let [Redeye talk some sense into you. It's esports.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO8IaV_DAoY) 

I'm a fellow competitive csgo follower (RIP Astralis era btw). Majority of India has no concept of esports. I think we need to convince a certain influential Gujarati man to educate our masses about esports, because I see no other way of esports growth in India. Not in the near future at least. People don't considered gaming/streaming an occupation here. I bet most of the people don't know about joining esport orgs For e sports to be a thing people must buy the damn games.Excluding cheap and free games like CS,Dota,TF2 etc which game has a large enough player base to even ask this question? pc parts cost 2x more in India and people don't think its good investment. The reason why esports haven't taken off in India is that we don't have any fallback options. There are no social safety net and any breaks taken during education is extremely frowned upon by Indian society and in extent Indian firms. Let's say, you try your hands on esports, you play well but not good enough to make a living out of it. Then you need to get a job and that's only backed up by education. No firm will hire you if you put esports in your cv. Not to mention if you take a break in your studies to pursue esports, there's a good chance your cv will be thrown into the dustbin even before it reaches the interviewer.

The same is applicable for other type of sports. Football is very popular in West Bengal, but most players are struggling hard to make ends meet. If you've watched Dangal then you'd know what happens to Amir in the movie is a reflection of what happens to our society in general. The only two ways to make an honest living in India is either through education or through business. Esports won't help you in either in the long run. Don't you remember the PM referencing pubg? I feel that e-sports is pernicious for the society in general. It promotes an unhealthy lifestyle. Playing video-games for long enough to become the best at them ought to have a deleterious effect on one's health, both physical and mental.

Real answer - ICC isn’t really interesting in growing the game unless it can find $$$ there, which is why it’ll try to grow the game in the US but do jack shit for UAE despite being HQ’d in it 🤦‍♂️ I've been wondering the same thing. Currently in the US and there are a lot of British expats at work and none seem to be following cricket. I'm beginning to think that ever since the 2010s after India won the world cup, the game has become ""more South Asian"" for lack of a better phrase. Growing up in the 90s, it wasn't like this. British and Aussie cricketers were not just sports stars but we're also page 3 personalities. I don't think it is like that anymore. Does anyone remember Shane Warne and Liz Hurley? I believe there is a change in the demographic. As someone else mentioned in this thread, the Brits at work are actually more interested in the Women's soccer world cup than icc. I guess the grapes are sour? I would say outside the subcontinent cricket is a very 'niche' sport - it does have followers and some kids playing it, but not really big among the general pubic. Who gives a shit . Americans themselves don’t bother if their sports are popular elsewhere neither should we . Sub continent where a quarter of the world population follows it generates decent revenues for the ICC. Australia has proper cricket fans who aren't seasonal followers of the game #No I can tell that in the nordic regions, Cricket is pretty much a niche sport. There are a few clubs who play cricket but thats about it, the general public do not care about it. In the UK more people are following the Women's World Cup (soccer) than they are the cricket world cup.  Wimbeldon has started and so the CCWC is probably down to number 3 in terms of viewing figures.  In terms of general interest...it's niche. Nope, even Australia and England has stopped caring for it that much. Its become a niche sport outside of India.

Not an structural problem. We might be having more of these now. But MS came, he changed us, and delivered a World Cup. Before than he delivered a T20 cup, and after as an encore delivered a Champions Trophy. He also won us the mace of the best test team. We just started winning more. We were not scared of losing the match in first five over anymore. We had our finisher. Now, it was the time for them to be scared of us.

It's a testament to his resolve that a boy with not-so-great technique reached here, and it's a celebration of India's cricket that a boy from Ranchi could reach here. No longer is Indian cricket in those urban metro pockets. No longer a kid in Mumbai is sure to be in the team more than that kid from some tier 2 / tier 3 town whose father is working in small public sector job. Now, they compete for same prize. I hope India gets a transformational player from North East too, and truly make Indian cricket ""Indian"" cricket.

MSD truly changed us. If you don't see, just look at all the other Asian team around us, they win because of their individual brilliance, but they not outperform their ceiling. We were once like them. Then we started being not like them. We became a unit that wins. And, there's no one to thank more than MSD for that. 

Thank you, skip, the pleasure was all ours. Farewell. If I want to learn one thing from you, it's the ability to take both wins & losses, both good & bad, in the same way, in the same stride. For both are just impostors in this battle called life anyway.",Pakistan's Abhinandan advt angers Team India fans!

My mechanical professor misbehaved with a cute northie. Suspended.

Another mechanical professor (also hostel warden) tortured hostel students, he shit his pants when one student drank all-out mosquito repellant. He liked students who are scared easily and act like slaves. He had some kind of joy feeling powerful over these helpless kids who came to unknown city and stayed in that hostel.

My school math teacher was a hardcore christian, she gave special care to christian students. A non-christian student not scoring is dumb, but a christian student not scoring needed practice. 

Tuition teacher prefers talkative and jovial ones, he was a strict math teacher in KV but jovial and friendly guy in his tuition classes. He even teaches shortcuts and easy methods in tuition but not in school.

PT teacher was hell bent on sports and never let other teachers take PT period as substitute for their subjects. We all loved her. She liked the ones who got her medals in zonals.

My computer teacher liked the ones who are smart and answers questions first..Imagine students like Hermione from harry potter. 

Biology teacher was the best who genuinely worried about underperforming students. Never gave special attention to top students as they never needed it in first place


To answer your question, i think this is all subjective. i think it all comes down to have a student behaves with a teacher cuz even they are human and then comes all the other factors like academic performance etx [deleted] Kids who interact in class - not the ones who stare into the abyss like brain-dead zombies. Kids who question, challenge and provide alternative to what I teach. Kids who are cool and talk wittily - not the ""yes, sir"" kind of flattering dorks. I like if they are involved in extra-curricular activities, but it should not be at the cost of their primary goal - education.

P.S.: I am an Assistant Professor (Engineering) in a top government college. I teach online and one on one which makes for a very different experience than classroom teaching - the most inspiring ones are those who never give up. They may be less gifted, and scores may disappoint. But they tenaciously keep working and in the end their results have always surprised me.

Just last year one student who i taught over two years and despaired for his performance made it through to NIT Surathkal.

Another guy who I briefly taught in 10th, was pretty ordinary, but made up for that with insane amounts of work and got into IIT-B. There he stepped it up sleeping only 4 hours a day on occasion and won the Presidents Gold Medal. When he graduated, Stanford and MIT rolled out red carpets to welcome him to their campus.

I could go on, but these two really stood out. Not a full time teacher; help a few kids in my neighborhood with their studies. I try to get them to stay inquisitive, ask questions & accept it is alright to say ""I don't know"". School education discourages then from asking questions (especially if it falls outside their syllabus). [removed] Toppers Dead I like the ones who are curious about things.

Doesn't matter which subject music/sport/science/business/cooking/art whatever. They go and try to find the answers and come back with many questions. Watching that process, of them discovering things for the first time by their own effort is very inspiring and satisfying. IANAT but other half is. 

Recently she was most impressed by a student who was deported from another school after failing, came here, continued to do poorly upto preparatory exams but got things together, concentrated and worked hard and ended up in high sixties (%). Approaching the exams she used to say I will be most happy if this kid passes. And was ecstatic to see his scores finally. There were many kids in 90+ and 80+ range in the same batch.

I didn’t understand the last paragraph of the article. From what I understood, she had to train away from the actual training camp ? Because of finances?

I was under the impression that govt would take care of training for athletes at least  at the Asian Games level.

Was it a govt failure or is there some other story ? Can someone with Tamil knowledge who watched the interview help us understand ? God bless his soul, such a great father and a human. At least his sacrifices were not in vain and he will always live on in her heart! The headlines only made me emotional let alone watching the whole press conference.

May god bless her. Such a shame, to see Sports Min only advt. & Running virtually on Twitter. Even if they work 5% many aspiring athletes would put India on top on medal tally. Her hard work & her father's sacrifices did it all.

Just a general observation on the worldviews Indians have.
If you take a look at the article, you'll find some comments. The comment section is enlightening.

""Natural couples can procreate, but unnatural cannot..If unnatural is to become a norm, then we have to think seriously of bio-ethical issues arising therefrom..Better go the nature's way though we have got freedom, we can use it either way.""

""Shows a great decline in ethical and value understanding, forgetting what our ancestors (the great rishis) and developing a slavish western educated attitude(so-called modern)
Doom is near when we forget ours roots.""
***
This is a very very *healthy sign* that the times we are livin' in is 1319,not 2019.
As for the rishis,if this gentleman had the time to look into our scriptures,he would find the Ardhanarishwara form(which celebrates feminity). Countless other refutes could be provided.
It's high time,we step up the ante,and counter them. These kind of mentality would only cause our society to move towards an intellectual dark age. 
I'm simply surprised,that every divine pronouncement is taken support to voice his beliefs about ""unnaturality"" and the fact that ""it won't support procreation"".
Sir, we're already with a burden of overpopulation. If some people don't procreate (by virtue of nature), it's for better.

Speaking of Indian lesbians, I recently watched Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga. I'll be honest, I've always disliked Sonam and Anil Kapoor for their acting. But the movie, was really touching. 

It helped a lot that Sonam didn't wear much makeup and it was not glamour-themed like most movies are. It helped to focus on the plotline which I think was VERY cute.

849,Sports,"I don't think anyone rates him for his  personality, He is a brilliant cricketer with the typical mainstream Punjabi/Delhi attitude.  If it was not for his cricketing talent and hardwork, he would've been another Sreensanth. When did this become Unpopular? It’s a free country. He is as free to be himself as you are to dislike him. Why devote so much time to thinking about people who have no influence on your life whatsoever? I have gone from being a hater to absolutely adoring him (no homo). 

He earned all the respect through unbelievable consistency, performing everywhere in the world and conquering all challenges posed to him. Kohli is probably not as gifted as Sachin BUT he more than makes up for that through elite level of fitness that allows him to run doubles after scoring a hundred at same speed when he came on the crease. 

He plays cricket for India and is bloody good at it, that's all that matters. If you want to hear his side of the story then watch Nat Geo Masterclass episode on him.

Edit: No doubt he's bit of an asshole. He's a sports person and every sports person has their own style. You can see that in different sports as well. See Ronaldo, Djokovic they have so much anger on the field because that helps them. So what's wrong? 
He's not the most talented cricketer like Rohit Sharma, but he's the best cricketer in the world right now due to his hard work and  determination and dedication to fitness.
( I met Virat once off the field, he's a really kind person and gentleman. ) I don't care about his personality. He's a great player. Rohit sharma is a gifted and telented batsman.However , Virat kohli is Hardworking batsman and if history has proven one thing that is hardwork beats talents. If you see earlier records(under nineteenth even couple of years after) compare Rohit sharma and virat kohli you will find that sharma was little ahead and cricket came naturally to him.However Virat kohli is diciplined ,hardworker and he did not had butter chicken in last 4 years(heard in an interview) compare love handles of rohit sharma.Nothing against rohit sharma, Scoring 264 in an international is nothing sort of a miracle. But virat kohli is different he has picked his sacrifices ,He is impatience but compensate with perseverance. He is constantly trying improve not only his game but also in other life aspects.Whenever he is on Buses he make sure that he reads self improvement book.I am not fan of virat kohli but i am fan of his dicipline and regime. Aggression is absolutely necessary in competitive sports. Cricket in particular. 

Some manifest that aggression through shrewd tactics, some do it in body language, and some really talented ones do both. Whats up with everyone hating his aggression on the field?

Just because Dhoni was cool, not everyone can be like him

If you are expecting everyone to be nice to everyone then you must living in an another dimension Sexy cricketer though, his batting is poetry in motion. Doesn't hurt that the helmet means I don't have to look at his face. He has matured after marriage.

What Rahul Dravid is saying about him

>Staying authentic  
>  
>People ask me why I didn’t behave like Virat when I played for India. I would have been inauthentic to myself had I gotten tattoos and behaved like Virat.  
>  
>Sometimes, before an Australia series, Virat says the most outrageous things. I read it in the newspaper and cringe. But then, I feel that he wants that tough contest, and wants that lip on the field, because it gets the best out of him.  
>  
>You can’t blame him, because it works so very well for him. But that may not be everyone’s cup of tea. Ajinkya Rahane, for example, is very different.  
>  
>What worries me is that a lot of young kids tend to copy Virat, without realising that they are not being authentic to who they really are. Guys, there is a term called sportsmanship. It means playing competitively and yet respecting the game and the opponent players. You just cant go bad mouthing and showing frustation every time you get a chance. Thatbis just bad faith. First Kohli seemed to do this coz of his immense passion, these days it seems like he just fcuking hates his opponents. No matter how good you are, when you play at the level he is, you habe the resposibility of maintaining a decorum. See tennis for reference. I don't understand the folks here. First you guys cry about the 'Log Kya kahenge' attitude of parents. And when someone doesn't give a damn about it, you turn back and say ' Hooo, you're a role-model, act like it'. Why TF should he care what people & kids think about him? I'm glad others in this world who care about cricket see Kohli's abuse-filled aggression as a passion for the game. No doubt he's one of the best in the world out there, but if the same abuse that he spews on-field if done on the street he could face criminal charges for abusive behaviour. Sadly commentators misinterpret as the passion so does the media, and budding cricketers and youth use the same in their field of work too. [deleted] Slightly late to the party but anywho - 

VK is definitely not overrated. Over the years, he has changed from a brash, immature gaali-spewing young boy to a calmer, more mature man. This was evident by the way he has carried himself in the public eye, most remarkably when he defended his then-girlfriend (and now wife) Anushka Sharma when she was getting trolled by his supporters. It is important to note that he started his career at an early age and since then, he has been under scrutiny. All of us were dumb as teenagers, just that our antics were not scrutinized by the media. 

If anything, Virat Kohli should be a role model for all young boys. He lost his father when he was barely in his teens, went to play a match while grieving his death, led his team to victory, made the team, became the best damn player that India has seen in a long time and is now leading the team to victory in the CWC. That too, without any connections or influence - purely on the basis of his talent and hard work. He also seems to be popular with his team and has their respect and support. He is a supportive husband who is not afraid to show his love for his wife and to stand up for her. His aggression is a part of his game and it is what makes him, him. I don’t think that’s a valid reason to hate on him, given that the aggression has never transformed into anger issues giving way to physical violence. 

He is a shining example of how your talent and hard work can take you to dizzying heights. As far as pure skill and temperament goes he is in his own league. He is better than sachin. I don't think He's overrated.  He deserves to run his mouth and act like douche all he wants if he can back it up. You don't have to love his personality, just his cricket. 

Makes it all the more fun and satisfying to watch him be cocky and then get outplayed and humbled by the other team every once in a while. I loved old virat... exactly for his hot headed behavior.

In this country woth all our bullshit like repect elder, respect the tradition, act mature bla bla bla he was such a nice change..

He used to have ""fuck you i have skills back up my attitude"" mentality which was so fucking inspirational. India needed young energy like him which showed that skill and hard work are the most important not sucking to people above you.

Now he has matured though which is also good.

In a healthy society hard working successful people should be  celebrated and respected..virat is beast when it comes to hardwork He is a great player which is what matters I'm a big big Kohli fan. 

He's a run machine. Probably the best white ball batsman ever. Never ever seen someone so consistent as him. The only thing that keeps him going is his ferocious intensity. On field he might be a nightmare for opposition, but off the field, he does come across as a very cool guy. Have seen almost all of his interviews and found none where he acted as a dick. 

Everyone has their own strengths that gets the best of out them. Dhoni's calmness maybe, but for Virat, it's his agression and intensity. 

As Harsha Bhogle said it, you take intensity out of Kohli, there's no Kohli left. 

Btw, Dhoni isn't cool/calm. Raina had pointed it out during one interview that Dhoni frequently gives a stick (which is not wrong). Abused Manish on camera ( again, nothing wrong) and latest where he came on field to confront the umpire for the no-ball call. I realized it a long time ago, before he was crowned a legendary status. You woke up pretty late. I have never seen a biggest snob in the sports before Kohli. Overrated? No motherfucker he's not. You'll understand when you start watching cricket. I don't know why Indian fans are so obsessed with behaviour. A cousin who lives in Australia told me how many fans he has there. FFS, understand the sport. You'll know he's already a legend. And he's better than Dhoni. Idk why Dhoni has more fans than Sachin and Dravid. Dhoni can't perform outside India. He's overrated. Yeah, I know this comment will be downvoted to oblivion. No shit. People are generally pretty obnoxious when it comes to Hero worship, and the cricket fans take it to the next level. I support this opinion. He is absolutely loved by media

Makes a lot more sense after this TRAI thingy. Paid around 600 for a lot of channels. Now I only have like 15 paid channels along with free channels and paying 260 for it. I wish some sense prevails and TRAI brings back revised older tariff as even the pack with all my favorite channels set me back only around 400 and for the same now, I need to pay for 700!! WTF! They must limit the rate of broadcaster bouquet packs. e.g. the rate of HBO HD is 12Rs. While the Turner HD+ pack of HBO, Disney, WB is 12.50 Rs. So why would anyone choose just a single channel if they can get more channel at the same rate or slightly more? There must be a rule that the rate of a bouquet must not less than, say 70% of total of rates of channels. Then only broadcasters will be forced to keep the price per channel low. Tariffs need to go higher not lower, or get ready for longer ad breaks, ads even taking up screen space during regular programming, and even more substandard content.

861,Sports,"Cricket fatigue is definitely a thing, especially if your favourite team performs bad year after year.

I stopped watching Cricket after the loss in 2015 WC and the ban of CSK in 2015. I remember being too bored and tired of it.

I started watching Cricket again from last year's IPL and found myself enjoying it again. Last year's IPL was amazing. Its made all the more fun by participating in the live threads on r/Cricket. i am in with you. IPL is too much hype and the teams dont give a shit I hope it doesn’t tire them out before the World Cup. All Indian team players should take it easy and use the matches as practice. I agree, idk wtf happened to rcb.  Like everything in life. Bro I stopped watching cricket after 12 std. Got too bored. You have grown older, now you shoulder more responsibilities. IPL has started already? I'm not kidding. I seriously wasn't aware.  Yep. I miss the olden days of cricket. It's hard to stay interested if a month-and-half(?) long event that happens every year. The players keep hopping teams. BCCI adds and removes teams as it pleases. Nothing about the format inspires loyalty towards any team. The whole tournament is designed to squeeze out maximum number of matches.

But in general I stopped caring about cricket a while ago so that's definitely the biggest reason.  I lost interest after 2011.

It all started looking fake (for me) and all sugar coated stuff. Plus all the money that goes into it. Not sport but manufactured entertainment. Slowly losing interest cause my team keeps losing.  Not just you. I only watched the first edition of IPL out of novelty. Then I used to fake interest in order to fit in. Now I don't care. >I followed the IPL for the first 3 editions. 

Same here. I lost interest after 2011.

It all started looking fake (for me) and all sugar coated stuff. Plus all the money that goes into it. My interest has actually grown more than ever. :) so many matches. I can't even recall the name of team now. yep for first 2-3 seasons was good. 

But too many matches. I have stopped watching test n one day also. 

Only 20-20 n all world cups. I lost interest in IPL 2 itself I've lost interest in cricket. I don't even recognize some players in our current national team.

IPL is one of the reasons I lost interest.

Just too much cricket.  Give it a time. Its just first match. Few interesting matches and you'll be discussing/checking score every minute.  Stopped watching cricket after the college. Stopped following after Dravid retired. I lost interest after major players moved to different teams, so this was several years ato. The team's didn't mean anything to me anymore. Lost interest.  same here bro   
not following from atleast 3 years I watched the motobhai team documentary (I have a daily data quota and I intend to use  it to the full). Pretty boring but I was in suspense since I didn't know the result and was pleasantly surprised when the team was booted before the knock-off stages started. 

I'm just tangentially aware but it seems like either Dhoni's or Chowkidar Gambhirs team wins every year. I think even the more avid fans will be giving it a miss this time. The World Cup is just around the corner for Gods sake! Who the eff gives a flying eff for T20s right now! dream11 will bring back that ""interest""? :P They already play 370 days a year and now this IPL , one series ends n they leave for another . I am really bored to be honest. I don't watch cricket, never did. No interest in cricket. Sitting in front of the TV was not an option in school days and college life was too hectic. After college finished there's no time for tv. I like fishing, it is what me and Dad did in free time back in the day.  People who gave up Cricket after their team lost something were never fans of the game.  Yea. Like today's KKR match, and here I am, browsing reddit. Even two years ago, I would've been hooked to the screen. I havent watched cricket since dhoni won us the world cup I don't even know why Indians like cricket so much. There are other sports as well.  It's not just the IPL. It's cricket as a sport which has become dull and boring for me. As an Indian, I already feel the pride of knowing that my team is (arguably) the best in the world. But can we now move on and set bigger targets more appropriate for the second most populous nation? 

I can't seem to understand why everyone continues to ignore the fact that we are horrible at football, hockey, basketball, tennis and pretty much all major sports that have global participation.

Screw you TRAI^2 TRAI has always been a loser when it came to the public. They were not able to reduce the call drops. They totally screwed us during net neutrality until (due to immense public pressure) they decided to go with it. And now this. Its time TRAI is held accountable for its existence.  TRAI anticipates that channel prices will come down gradually.

But I'd say get a firestick , a decent broadband connection and subscription of those streaming apps. I switched and never lookd back to DTH.  I am an Indian who stays in bangalore who watches content from almost all the channels (kannada, tamil, telugu, hindi, english) and I have to pay almost around 800 ish if I want to have the same experience. So fuck me right TRAI. Real dick move by TRAI This pricing scheme is helpful only for people who watched very few channels to begin with. TRAI had put a cap on discount that operators could provide in bouquets. 15% max discount on bouquet than a-la-carte. That would have gotten the price of individual channels down. All operators went to Madras High Court against this rule where HC ruled against TRAI. With much lower prices for bouquets than a-la-carte, operators are basically forcing you to take their bouquets instead of going alacarte way. [As of now, TRAI has withdrawn 15% discount cap petition from Supreme Court] Same here.

My yearly subscription will end soon. I have already subscribed to Sony Liv and Zee5. Will subscribe to Hotstar soon and too voot when they will have live channel available (they don't have subscription model as of today). It will cost me around INR 3000  per year. I have got 150gb broadband connection which is never utilized. So I'll be getting all the channels for 250 per month and since I have multiple TV, the average will be much less. I thank TRAI for screwing up this well. I think I was way too comfortable with what I had. They made me rethink the entire cabel cost optimization. Removed sony channels. Got Sony liv yearly subscription.   I used to pay 280 for all the channels, now I have to pay 600 for the channels which me and my parents watch. Go to hell TRAI.  Mine went from 280 to 200 [deleted] I used to pay 600ish monthly. Now it's half that. Thank you TRAI, I guess? Cost reduced for them who only watched Republic TV.. Mine went down from 300 to 275.

I watch only SD and don't have any hindi GECs. I think those channels are really expensive and pack costs have gone up for those watching hindi GECs.. for rest there is definitely a decline.

Also those who watch a limited number of channels have benefited while those who watch a large set have been fucked. TRAI are absolute dickheads.. We should also blame the government for letting this happen.  Tbh the problem isn't with TRAI , it's the nature of DTH and cable market which is against any good reform in the sector. By bumping up each channel rates to such an high price they say either toe the bouquet way or opt the alacarte model at your peril. 

I hope in coming days they reform the cost of Channels to the optimum cost. I'm on the other side of the coin. 

My monthly cost came down because I barely watch TV. I just picked the packs for channels my mom watches and I was done. I just add the sports channels on the days when there are matches I want to watch and remove them the next day.

 That's it. Ridiculous.  ""Your costs will be lower when you stop watching TV"" -- xoxo, TRAI I was paying 550 + 250 for a long duration pack. Now paying 300 + 250 (multi TV) Earlier you were probably being subsidised by those users watching fewer channels paying more than what they actually needed. Time to pay your fair share.

Looking at the pricing on TRAI [website](https://channel.trai.gov.in/), most of the channels cost ₹7 or less. Of those you mentioned, Sony, Sony sports channels and Colors cost ₹19 (and even these are available in bouquets to lower costs). I don't see how you can be mad at TRAI when they're instituting a per channel pricing and making it transparent. I don't understand how can anyone enjoy all the stupid bullshit they show on Indian tv. In recent years Indian influences have destroyed the only good channels worth watching like CN, NICK, DISCOVERY, NAT GEO, HISTORY etc.. Anyone intelligent in their right mind would cut the cable and use internet to watch anything entertaining. I had to keep the connection just for my parents and they too don't watch serials and all the vomit inducing reality shows. So this new system is pretty great for me. I just chose very few channels that we actually flip through. only 300 rs. 
 Try getting packs...I only watch sports (football) and I got a pack that was cheaper than selecting one by one, use the trai website to see cheapest plan I think those who watch more channels should be given some discount . I pay  250 for cable, and have almost channels.
Except some sports channels. Because they are expensive.
Now we will have to pay shit loads. Same here. I used to pay 400 for all HD and SD channels. Now I am getting only sony sports pack and star value pack.
I am actually shocked.
I am just waiting for Giga fiber and giga tv.  Exactly!

Had to forego the HD channels in order to get my prices lower than the previous package which had HD + SD. I have 4 tata sky connections. 1 primary and 3 multi tv(you have to pay full cost for primary and 250 each for multi tv). Out of the 4 TVs, 2 are HD supporting and other 2 are old school CRT. 

I was paying 750 for my primary and another 250+250+250 for my other connections. I had all HD & SD channels tata sky offers on its platform.

Now if I subscribe to a HD channel, I don't get its corresponding SD channel with it. So i can't watch HD channels now.

FUCK YOU TRAI I think these new DTH rules will benefit us in the long run.

As people start subscribing lesser number of channels, expect broadcasters to reduce their prices. Channels will lose a great deal of advertising revenue if they continue to price their channels so high.

My opinion - Wait and watch for a couple of months. Things will become clear.  Some people here and in other similar threads claim that hotstar and Sonyliv is a viable alternative. It's simply not for sports. I've a decent net plan (around 50mbps) and yet, when India plays, the quality is pathetic (Looks like 144p even when you select full HD) . It's alright while watching on your phone but you simply can't watch it on your TV.  Ftom 250 earlier to a steep 610 this month.

Fuck you TRAI and your ""Revolutionary"" step.  Iptv is your friend There are bouquet(bundled channels from company) eg-Times now hd bouquet at 15rs includes mn+,movies now,mnx,romedy now etc.
Choose the channels wisely ,for me it has reduced from 400 to 230rs. from my understanding, this whole exercise was to make dth expensive and complicated for the normal household. so that when jiofiber comes with all inclusive plan, customers would flock to it. and dth companies would disappear the same way most of the telecom companies have disappeared. in the end, only tata sky might survive along with airtel.  Do people actually still watch TV? Mine went from 420 a month to 320 I think Go for a google certified android box or you are in luck if you have android tv :) prefer online apps maybe one day they will come up with providing the option of the individual channel pay on IPTV :) Wait for JIO cable to come, it will be cheap then.

Either way, I'd say the rising Hindutva caused Muslims to move towards a more conservative Islam. The Babri masjid was a culmination of anti muslim efforts that solidified the divide between hindus and muslims. RSS has been hard at work at unifying hinduism and it has done so by othering muslims. no secret there

 Whether you like it or not , we live in a pluralistic society so there is no distinction between Indian values and Islamic values , rather it is a superset of all religious values . Islamic extremism and fundamentalism is now a global problem but you are making things worse by giving counter productive measures which are perceived as Anti Muslim sentiment .

The problem with most Muslim Indians is that they r usually from lower middle class where religion plays a heavy role. As people become rich they would start becoming more integrated  Who is supporting Islamic Fundamentalism in opposition to Hindutva?

The only difference between your arguments and a generic RW argument is that you've prefaced yours with ""I am a liberal"" with a heavy dose of r/EnlightenedCentrism > Islamophobia in West and India have completely different roots IMO. I think for Indians, it's the rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values, that has Hindus riled up.

Lol no. Even before Independence there was Hindu-Muslim rivalry to the extent that the Muslims wanted a separate country. Most bhakts still bring up Akbar and Aurangzeb and rant about how they destroyed temples and whatnot. 
 > I think for Indians, it's the rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values, that has Hindus riled up.

If you call yourself a liberal after making this bigoted statement that completely whitewashes history, you need to take a long lok at yourself in the mirror.

Hatred of muslims is going on this country for decades. Advani led a stupid ac rath yatra to pull down a archeologically significant mosq in 1992, FFS. What has changed is that the present government has made it easy for bigots to come out of the woodwork and wear their bigotry on their sleeves. I'm totally against Modi but I don't support INC either. To be honest I don't support anyone. I just go to BJP posts and write *Gali gali me shor hain, chowkidar chor hain* to get those Chowkidars offended.

Also one question as a food for thought.

&#x200B;

Muslims have been living in this country for over a 1000 years now , they have every right to claim India as their native land, anybody who believes that Muslims will leave India and go to Pakistan, has basically given up on all reason.

Yes. I am a a liberal and can't stand the divide that Modi's propaganda has created in Indian society. But an opposition of right wing ideology doesn't mean that you end up supporting INC and its policies, which are not completely liberal either.

Their are certain well known (blue tick) handles on Twitter, who have a liberal viewpoint. Few live abroad. I normally agree with their viewpoints, but much to my dismay, some of them seem to support INC, and are happy to see Priyanka join the campaign. Those people have completely forgotten how the nepotism in INC, It's corruption or how it has exploited minorities for its own gain, say Shahbano case.

But this is just the beginning. In their hatred for Modi and his supporters, these handles seem to support or retweet (fundamentalist) Muslim ideology. For anyone who has spent last 30-40 years observing Indian society must have sure seen the gradual shift in ideology of Indian Muslims too. Sudden religious awakening, donning of beard/Hijab (As a kid, never saw a Muslim woman wearing a Hijab). 

Islamophobia in West and India have completely different roots IMO. I think for Indians, it's the rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values, that has Hindus riled up.

#EDIT
As some have pointed out, and I agree, that this is in no way proof or indicator that these three are better than the greats mentioned in the list. There are too many variables like home/away split, no. of matches they played together, quality of opposition etc. The thing to emphasize here is that they are 'among the best' and it was something unprecedented from Indian team. I remember the time when Venkatesh Prasad's fast deliveries were slower than Kumble's slow ones.

The current crop have been brilliant. If only our batting line up were a little more consistent overseas, we'd have won more than one Test in each of those series outside of India. If our batting was consistent, we could have won the series in England and Australia.  Is this for when the three of them played together? Or if in one match Umesh was in instead of Shami, for example, would the other two's wickets still add up to the total? Misleading stat. For every other trio they are showing the stats for games all played together, whereas for Indian bowlers their grand totals for the year are taken into account. Bumrah missed first 2 tests in Eng which Shami and Ishant played. For Grand totals Steyn,Ntini,Morkel have 171 in 2008 but they show only 123


Edit: looks it’s only away for away tests but it’s not doing justice to other bowlers as their away test matches include not so pacer friendly pitches of subcontinent. 

with Bumrah’s introduction Indian bowling has definitely improved in tests TBH I'm surprised Jimmy+Broad+Woakes/Stokes/Bresnan/Misc don't feature in the top 5. What about the number of matches played? I hope SENA keeps preparing bowler friendly like they have this season.  Some people are laughing that cricket is followed with such a Zeal in a former colonial state... 

I mean it's one thing to beat them on their own turf, and another abandoning all reason and sports.  Awesome.. but no terror in the heart .. which Holding and company invoked. Bumrah has really shown immense talent n balled on spot Interestingly enough this stat isn’t showing how many matches they played for those wickets I’m sure India plays 3 times more test in a year than those guys ever did  Wonderful stat...Bumrah has certainly the potential to become the greatest Indian pace bowler of all time And this is excluding bhuvi's contribution Fuck cricket. [deleted] Wow..  surprisingly there are no Australians  Yeah but back then there was no match fixing. Today all matches are more or less fixed, so can't say that the information or statistics are accurate. Doesn't cricket get enough media attention already? Rather bland content considering this is reddit.
Just my opinion that's all. I don't particularly like or dislike cricket,but I am rather tired of reading about it everywhere.
For instance, recently, we partook in a Hockey world cup and were consequently eliminated in the quarter-finals. All the newspapers I have access to either relegated this news to the last page favouring the test match against Australia over it, or didn't mention it at all. I get that they're trying to sell their papers, albeit I think a full fledged world-cup takes precedence over a run-off-the-mill test match.
We are hasteful to be delighted about our athletes performing well in various sports, albeit when it comes to supporting those very athletes, we turn our backs and cast them a blind eye.
India needs to learn to comprehend and be privy to all of its talent, not just a select few. I find it rather sad, or moreover callous that Sunil Chhetri had to do what he did just to get people to come and watch the national team play ON HOME SOIL. Very very sad indeed.

877,Sports,"Betting is not legal in India (depending on the type of betting and place, again), but fantasy sports is legal.

As per Sec 12 of Public Gambling Act of India, ""skill based games are not covered under gambling in India"".

Hence games like fantasy cricket/sports and rummy for that reason, come under ""skill based games"" hence out of the purview of gambling.

While lottery, betting on sports (not fantasy sports), and other card games like flush etc come under betting.  There was a case againt dream11 and they won. Google it. Skill games - No ban, but again the decision is taken by the state law.

Dream11 & Online Rummy - does not falls under gambling as these games requires skills to play.

Though few states like - Telangana, kerala, assam, nagaland & orissa banned all the games where money is involved.

Supreme court gave rule rummy as game of skill but few states banned it. Although site owners are fighting for this but no result yet. Gambling law in India is a bit complicated. For something to be gambling you generally need the following components:

1. Uncertain event - you don't know what the outcome will be.
2. Consideration - you're paying something to participate. 
3. Prize - you are competing or participating for a prize.

You need all three elements. Zynga poker is not prohibited because there is no prize (under Indian law). 

Generally, games of skill are not treated as gambling. Different states have imposed different standards. Telangana took the position that ANY element of chance would make it a game of chance. West Bengal on the other hand, treats poker as a game of skill. This boils down to whether a game is preponderantly that of skill or chance. 

The Supreme Court has some cases in which they decided whether some games are gambling. 

1. Horse race betting - game of skill - people can research conditions of horse, skill of jockey, etc. That takes skill. 

2. Rummy - game of skill - can learn card combinations, etc

3. Poker (Gujarat HC) - game of chance - no skill involved and poker is preponderantly a game of chance. (Lol)

Basically a lot of things are uncertain until a court decides if a game is predominantly that of skill or chance. 

 It depends on region to region. That's what I have seen  They'll do anything for money. There's no surprise there. If the company gets caught doing something illegal, the most these cricketers/actors say is, ""sorry, I was not aware of this"".

Till 18, I played Cricket, Football, Badminton, Table Tennis, Track&Field and Hockey (sometimes) and was into NCC. I was like crazy into sports, followed everything from nba to tennis to badminton to cricket etc etc. They used to air sportscenter on ESPN India @8pm which I would watch with full excitement. I played at district level and a couple of cbse clusters. So I'd say for my entire teen years I liked to play and be outdoors most of the time, going around, riding bicycles and doing shit. Well, sadly life took a 360. I moved to a different town, lost all my school friends plus went out of state for college. At college, all of my interest got lost somehow and done nothing except binge and sleeping. In other words, I turned into an extreme intorverted guy and felt comfortable around myself and started to grow my hair to look cool and headbang a little. Well, there's one thing that helped me by playing different games was fitness. Football and Badminton helped my leg muscles a lot and I think also helped my height ig. I haven't been to a gym ( to this day ) and don't plan to because I never needed to.
23 now btw. Life's been depressed for the last 4 years. I get emotional thinking how cool my teen life was. Now everything is shit. 
Good luck to you.

 I find outdoor activities useless.
Lets say I play cricket. 

While batting , I hit a shot. Some cringy kid shouts ""Oyeee abe shai se bol fek na yaar"". I just stand there and wobble my butt. I waste 30 seconds waiting for another ball.

Some kid does a good fielding while the wicket keeper shouts ""Are chaccha chaccha chacchaaaa chaccchhhaaaa. Oyeeee sahi hai sahi hai sahi haiiiii!""

Batsmen running with their balla and wobbling butt.

Ballers shouting oooyeeee after every ball.

Fielders clapping because there is nothing else to do.

Outdoor activities are super mega cringy for me. I feel like smashing my bat on the face of every player that shouts or claps because he has to do ""something"" and can not stand idle. Starting off is the hardest part. Pick a sport and try to get into it. You should be able to find Badminton, Tennis, Cricket academies fairly easily. Find a sports complex or the kind. Or move to a building with a clubhouse. That'll be a good start. 

I'd recommend gym but typical Indian gyms are filled with steroid junkies and steroid recommending trainers specially when you're skinny.

I have recently started learning Badminton. The fuckers who play well try to fuck with you showing their game off, the best way is to not lose your will to learn and focus on getting as good as them and bearing them. 

I know people who started learning tennis when I played fairly Well and started bearing me in 7-8 months.

There are good technical guides to each sport online. By saying that 22 y/o is too late to start playing is a very lame excuse. Get your lazy ass up and start playing a game in which you have interest. You can start with TT, badminton etc.

I am assuming you don't go to gym so you can start focusing on your physique by joining a gym, first few weeks would be tough but once you get past it then it will get easier.

But seriously dude, GET YOUR LAZY ASS TO WORK Try Playo app.. The more you play the quickly you learn... Also, you can play Squash.. It is one of the few games which you can learn playing solo...  OP, first of all why do you want to get into sports? You say you have realized it is important. I don't deny the benefits, but what is your end goal?

Is it something specific like playing at a professional level or just something to keep you active and engaged?

If it is the latter, learn like how a child would. Just by playing it for fun. Find some of your colleagues who'd go for playing sports and ask them to tag you along for a game. Regularly do that. You will not only learn the sport gradually, but you'll have fun doing it as well. Not to mention that it will vastly improve your social circle.  Really depends on where you're from but there's always coaching centers for most sports. No age is too late to join these classes. My uncle started Table Tennis coaching at 40 years age and now he's addicted to it. You gotta spend money but that money is definitely worth it in the long run. What do u like to do most? If u like cricket, hang out near cricket grounds and start talking to them. They can always use an extra player. Same with any other sports. 

If u don't ask, u wont get it. Start making progress little by little. 22 is still young to give up.  Bowling. It is really fun.   Advice from 29 year old guy:

- Smoked from 18 years to 28 years. realised its a huge mistake and here is how I got into active sports.

- stopped smoking cold turkey.

- Started running, small distances and sprints. progressed and completed Two Half Marathons.
- Bought bike(cycle) and along with running, ride 25-50 kms. If you can't bike daily, then on weekend ride 30-50kms. It looks daunting but your legs will get used to it.
- Start Badminton.
- Start Swimming.

Schedule:

- 2-3 times running
- 1-2 times Badminton
- 1-2 times Bike
- 1-2 times swimming

Now start looking into Marathons/Dualthon/Traithlon. Forget social media and open account in starva, follow people and sync your activities there.

If at 29 years I could do it, you are just 22 and can definitely do it. 

Good luck.  Honestly it'll be very tough for you to get into a sport at this age. I assume you'd want to play with people your age cause it'll be weird for you to play with school kids right. Unfortunately most people your age would be those who actively enjoy the sport and have been playing for many years. They'll be way better than a noob and you won't be able to develop your skills to a good enough level to enjoy playing with them.

I don't mind you not liking my food but I don't think you should live in our country and like other's thing. Get your priorities sorted.""   His inner bhakt surfaces. Khud shaadi baahar ja kar ki thi, wahi reh jaaye.

Not that I think like that, but I am applying his argument to him. This leave if you don't like something argument is pure retarted. Why is this argument so popular? I don't like foreign batsmen nor Indian ones, but if you are paying for my tickets and visa then I'll say that I like foreign batsmen more than Indians. Get me moving now! BTW I like New Zealand batsmen better just so you know where to send me. Fortunately that fan didn't say that he likes to see Pakistani batsmen in action. Otherwise he would have celebrated this Diwali in Pakistan. Nice political play there kohli. Polarize first! Address the issue later. How I wish this was fake. Is bhenchod ke liye jo zaraa sa  respect tha, woh bhi nahi rahega bahut jald. At least sehwag showed his colours *after* his career over, yeh to abhi shuru ho gaya.  This is a statement of inadequacy from a batsman who has it all to become a legend of the game  Sir but i have a Aadhaar card. 'Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel' By his logic he should - Sponsor only indian brands, leave India if you sponsor uber, nike, nestle, puma. Set your priorities right Virat.

This comment section, twitter outrage shows why India will never have any show like Colbert, Bill Maher, John Oliver or any political comedy show.

His response was really bad, the response should be 5-6 words max and shouldn't need to be explained. I feel like that comment might be fake, it sounds very condescending, ""these Indians"" I mean WTF. Also don't think anyone would describe Kohli as ""overrated batsman. Nothing seems special in his batting."" Kohli is the one of the few batsmen that is succeeding at all format.  Seemed kinda like those Jimmy kimmel mean tweet  thing people really need to loosen up these days.kohli isn’t known for his wit seemed like a poor joke nothing more nothing less. Top meme material right here. Cricketers shouldn't even joke these days because people will find some reason to get offended. This too with Kohli whose favorite batsman is probably ABD. Looks like most ppl didn't even watch the video to get the context. No wonder media can polarise people with their headlines. Its deeply upsetting.This is why we can't have nice things. Have hordes of ultra regressive conservative people in the country is bad enough. Just wake up and understand the context before you get all hyper and start hating the guy who is most likely more liberal than you. Idiots.. Comment taken out of context. 

Could have handled it better, yes. But it is not that big a deal it is made out to be. I hate it when people who have never watched sports in their lives start talking shit about players because of a random misinformed bias. He said in mockering way. He is kind of person who replies with BC to his bully while hugs to his friend. The questioner asked cringy question and the inner Delhi boi of kohli activated. That's it. Nothing else to discuss. This is ridiculously poor by Kohli. I thought Kohli of 2018 had matured in to a sensible stand up guy.  Any sport transcends nationalities and it's perfectly alright to have idols from other nationalities. How many kids growing up had their idols as Gilchrist, ABD, Sachin, Shane Warne, Mcgrath etc. That has nothing to do with nationality. Just shows is Kohli's mentality in a very poor light. This guy is such a dumb snobby arrogant bhakt! He thought Demonetization was the greatest political move ever.

Now he is asking people to leave India. This guy will be the CM of UP after fake Yogi becomes PM.

I think this was his brainfade moment. Unsure about the authenticity of the video. If it's real though, I find it hilarious he said that, especially since he didn't get married in India. Same logic hold true, no? Kohli's chaddi is showing.

Next, [removing high protein food like beef from the cricketer's menu](https://newsd.in/bcci-asks-cricket-australia-to-remove-beef-from-indias-menu/).

And now naming non-supporters as anti-Indians.

RSS wants to use the soft power of cricket to influence millions of Indians to abhor people who eat beef or non-supporters as anti-Indians, further creating divisive lines in our country and to push their own communal agenda.

I won't be surprised if in future Muslim players like Shami and Khaleel Ahmed get dropped from the Indian Cricket Team all Indians should leave India The beauty of any sports is the fact it transcends all barriers and binds people together in a common thread. Jingoism should have no place in it. I am a Virat Kohli fan because of his hard work and attitude but this shit is ridiculous.  I don't like any batsman,  i just hate virat koli. Does this mean i can stay?  I remember him using a stool to stand next to a tall female sportsperson. While undoubtedly a brilliant cricketer, not the brightest of bulbs otherwise.

We’d do better as a race if we follow people who are actually serving society than being insanely good at hitting a ball. I wonder what he has to say about the thousands of desi expat fans who come to see him and the Indian team play in the UK/Australia/other countries. Haha... Kohli should watch mean tweets. The Vedas say that all true Indians should believe India is the best at everything. Those who don't should go to Pakistan. I like lara more than anyone , I like Denis lily as bowler than anyone else.

I always wonder with guys like this if they believe that Indians still cheering for Indian sportsmen/women while living in America should come back to India? I am shocked and mind-blown that a progressive intellectual like Kohli has said this. Pfft. Fucking wanker. Intellect inversely proportional to batting skills....Indians have the habit of making gods of celebs, and to an extent then some will even try to justify their stupid remarks. Lol. Kiddo got offended  Why all of sudden he sounds like a BJP person ? He recently tweeted about his partnership with Tissot and he is their brand ambassador. Someone should tell him that if he prefers a foreign brand over Ajanta watches then he should leave India The country's been bhakt-up.  What else did you all expect from a modi fan. First, see the video and listen to the way he's speaking and then post such stuff. Don't make it look out more than what it is. Blowing things out of proportion. Are gusse me boldiya Kohli paaji ne.

So after Sehwag and Dhoni, Kohli preparing for a BJP ticket too? This man still doesn't have 'control over his mouth' at the big age of 30 sadly. The Australian media had a lovely time due to this during their test series here in 2017. Typical TDC. This arrogant prick is Indian cricket's Modi. OP’s user name makes sense.

Virat Kohli, you Sir are an idiot. He is becoming too arrogant ,if this is his statement Taken out of context, the 'Fan' pretty much called the Greatest Batsman at the moment overrated and then said that he'd rather watch Australians or English than 'these' Indians.

Tere baap ka hai kya india? chutiye Leave India if you like foreign wedding venues more than Indian ones.

Chutiya. His tone sounds very different in text and in video, but nevertheless that's a very stupid thing to say. Thought his PR team would have told him to handle it better and say the right things. Where cricket is the definition of patriotism.  One thing we need to learn is that good actors/artists/authors/sportsmen can be absolute rubbish humam beings. And it's fine. They don't owe anyone anything. They should be known for their craft and that's that.  I really live him as a cricketer, he has actually worked very hard and used his natural talent to be at zenith of the cricket. But this is an absolute rubbish reaction, you should only like Indian things otherwise you should leave the country!! Really who choose a foreign country for his marriage celebration, has sponsorship deals with multiple foreign brands like Puma, Audi, Tissot, Col-Pal more. 😶 Never liked him and his smugface. And, I love Cricket. The most shameful disgustingly highest run scorer who has shitty personality in India as a sportsman. Infact he is no sportsman at all.  Virat Kohli for all his glories as a batsman is a short tampered goon.

I don't like him at all. He is by far the worst person to be a captain of any team. It is clearly evedent that how he is a proper failure WITH RCB when he doesn't get the same guidance on how to run a team.  Waah. Those who endorse foreign brands like puma and oppo should leave also Replace"" batsmen"" with ""pornstars"" and read again.  Ah, I was wondering when the ""Delhi"" in him would start to show. About time.  What an utterly douchenozzley response from Kohli. Don't know what the guy he responded to meant by 'these Indians' though.

I don't think he meant that as is. Even I was slightly irked by that person's choice of words - as if he was trying to irritate Kohli deliberately. Notice that the person used words like English, Australian, rather than pointing out what actually they found in them other country players that ""Indian"" players were lacking,rather than them being Indian. 

Although Virat could've answered more clearly, I don't think it's his fault that he replied in such a manner.  Cricket is a pathetic, boring colonial game and such cringe does not help its case.

Someone needs to stop this overhyped crap sport from discrediting potential for other sports in this country already. He can go fuck himself.  Again this retard with his verbal diarrhea.  I think this is just a knee jerk reaction to criticism from a sportsman who has dedicated his life to the game. No one expects a leader of the sport to say something like this, but maybe just Kohli's immaturity in handling unexpected statements. Hopefully, he can work on it and improve. I liked this guy though i dont follow cricket anymore. Didnt know Kohli was a first grade cunt. Dilli ka chhora hai. Mean comments ko pyaar se reply nahi karega. Responding sledging with sledging. Videshi cricketers know it very well, now indian critics too.

Proud of you Kohli! Feels like most people don't get sarcasm nor do they have a sense of humour. Cricketers who have a political opinion like Kolhi, Sehwag, Gambhir should be arrested.  What does ""these Indians"" mean  Get a batting average like Don Bradman. Then tell other Indians to leave India I don't even like cricket. I think it's stupid. What should I do?

I love how he reads a comment on the internet and thinks that he should now weigh in as to what the person should do with his life. 

It wasn't even that bad a comment. Looks like we have a snowflake here.

It follows that representative of a sport should never be unmindful of his duties. By advocating popular and rabid form of nationalism kohli has done huge disservice.

There is no reason for me to think you showed so much promise in Tennis that you would have done fabulously (you have not really told me about the medals you won in your engg college sports activities, or in other external sports championships). 

You knew your parents for 18 yrs. They maybe experts in engg, or they maybe farmers...but basically their advice was given based on their experiences and the best advice they got. If you didnt show enough 'ability' in tennis - how the heck will they know .. you are gifted in tennis ??

It is easy to sift all the blame onto your parents for it all, but, that will only allow you to blame them for all your future choices too. Maybe it is time to figure out what exactly you want to do with your life and what you are good at and do something.

Not a football fan but would love to see indian football succeed and to that end I want to start following it from now on. Reliance is a private entity and I'm not sure why they'd want to to be involved in such a thing and we can of course discuss the visual of a private body doing something like this. But if they are involved I'm sure they're in it for the ₹₹. To eventually own the league formats and take it the cricket board route which is super rich. And so it's in their best interests to not fuck up selection and support it from the ground up. In what ways would they fuck it up? Private body involvement in cricket, hockey, kabbadi have yielded great results. Yeah it's not the traditional 'club' format just a show of such traditions but so what? Not defending Reliance, but i have seen first hand that reliance works/supports at grass-root level in football. My neighbour’s son in 6th standard got picked by reliance academy. Reliance moved him to mumbai, boarding/lodging/schooling and international level training absolutely free of cost. Last i heard, kids were being taken to London for EPL youth academy exposure. If a completly middle class KV schooled kid is being trained for future prospect, I think we should give atleast some credit to Reliance for it. Reliance/Motabhai has a say in *everything* in this country. Ambanis are the Lannisters. if reliance is involved then their end target is profit, profit which will come if the team performs .

It's for this reason I haven't watched a news show I think since the Nirbhay movement. Everything is measured by TRP and clicks, not by good outcomes for everyone.  Cut my cable back in Jan last year and got a Chromecast..its much better.. planning to get a mi box as it has more features While we ourselves may not watch Tv,  there are still millions whose only source of entertainment is the tv. 

My grandma would kill me if I take the tv away from her.  >I understand people still want to watch sports and news. We can watch these programs online for a very low fees.

Not everyone has access to unlimited high-speed internet. I live in a tier 2 city and I am finding it hard to give up on DTH and solely rely on the internet for streaming. Now think about those who are living in rural or remote areas or are not technologically savvy enough. It is not as easy as you are making it out.  6 years + here. Got feed up with mindless ads and 3rd class content. I do have all channels cause wife and mom. But me personally, I don't even know what to watch on TV lol. Used to be interested in news but there's nothing left there. 

So when I have absolutely nothing to do and I am tired of Netflix, YouTube, amazon prime, reddit... I turn on the TV, keep changing the channels for about 2 minutes and turn it off  Stopped watching. The most peaceful 1.5 yrs. Cable connection in my home is just for my grandma's shows. Okay some are saying they use Cable only because of their families. That's alright in my opinion. 
But atleast we can encourage our generation and younger generation who think they've got no other source of entertainment. Had been more than a year that I got rid of TV... Don't even own one now...have got so much free time now that I spend on improving myself. Where can we watch sports online for low fee? Amazon Prime Video ₹999

Hotstar Annual Sub    ₹999

Netflix(4 Person)         ₹200

I made the mistake of opening tv few times, what a bunch of crap that passes for a news, tv serial, reality shows etc, utter crap. The crap that we have on Indian tv will fall flat in front of any cable content from other countries. About time they think through how to make serials, news , reality shows, etc because newer generation of people simply aren't interested in watching TV at all. It's all about internet. Simple YouTube channels and news articles on the internet have better content than big media houses. And then comes these Netflix, Amazon prime, hulu type services that produces awesome content that people actually pay to see and can see it anytime any episode anywhere.

History was also created in Table Tennis as the bronze in men's team event was India's FIRST EVER medal of any kind in table tennis.

Kurash came as the surprise package of the day with India winning a silver and bronze in it. Getting a medal in an event dominated heavily by Uzbeks is no mean feat. Hopefully these medals will help in popularising this sport in the country.

​ Man manjit singh! What a champ!! Did anyone see that heat? Expecting a gold from Seema Punia. Hopefully she repeats her performance from the last edition.  Is it just me or scoring in boxing seems way too suspicious and shady? Jinson Johnson wins gold, to go with his silver in 800m. Manjit ends fourth, started sprinting thoda late. India have overtaken their 2014 medal tally, both in terms of gold and no. of medals (:  Commentators constantly calling the Bahrain athletes as Ethiopian and Kenyan athletes 😂 Damn what a run,Bahrain I think had 3 gold medallists,Hima Das's greatest moment so far at senior level. If we get 2 more gold medals then we will equal our record of maximum gold medals which was set in the first ever Asian Games in Delhi, 1951. Bros, sorry for this interjection. Seeing the number of sports fans here, can we please have a separate indian subreddit for sports?

I fear it may be flooded with Cricket. Assuming a few fans here would be interested, how to go about it? Our current tally of 23 silver medals is the most number of silver medals we have ever got in Asian Games. The second best is 19 silver medals in 1982 Delhi Asian Games. We  have reached 1000 comments  in this thread  one more record today So that's it? We end on 69? Bahrain and Qatar are participating in the wrong continental games.

Should be in the African one. Though find it amusing their athletes don't even murmur the national anthem 😂 Update - Swimming: Indian team qualifies for men’s 4x100m freestyle relay Final.  Update - Wrestling: India’s Harpreet Singh wins his bout against Heageun Park of Korea 4-1. He now enters the quarters.

 PV Sindhu enters quarterfinal by beating Indonesia's Tunjung GM by two games to nil. A huge upset in Squash as Goshal, the top seed is defeated. Very disappointing. 

Not much hope in Athetics other than Mohammed Anas, Dutee Chand and Neeraj Chopra.

I think we will fall woefully shot of gold medals this time and even overall medal when compared to 2014. Hima Das has qualified for women's 400m final. Indian team has won silver in Equestrian Eventing Team. The Indian team consisted of  Rakesh Kumar, Ashish Malik, Jitender Singh and Fouaad Mirza. Saina Nehwal is into the semifinal of women's singles after defeating Ratchanok Intanon. Sony needs to get better commentators (the analysts are ok I guess)  ,these seem of the old Doordarshan quality,not expecting them to have in depth knowledge but should know at least the basic rules  /nuances of games India are good in,during archery the commentator thought games was over after 21 out of 24 shots,despite Korea clearly keeping on shooting,a few days back he was screaming how an Indian wrestler was amazing in his defence in last few minutes as he won the last point only for the referee to raise the opponents hand(didn’t stop him screaming though),another one assured us of a medal for reaching the sf (he went on to lose the repechage),boxing guy has no confidence to say who is winning though I guess he honestly doesn’t make an attempt . We won two Silver medals in Equestrian - one for a team event and another an individual one.

Not too many people follow the sport but it's a great a achievement nonetheless. India vs S.Korea in both Men's & Women's compound archery team final Dutee Chand silver ,lost by 0.02s Goving Lakshmanan who earlier won the bronze in 10000 m race has been disqualified because his foot touched inside the race track. Gonna be a very tough fight for both Saina and Sindhu. Sania has to gave the world number 1 and Sindhu has to play the world number 2. It's not gonna be easy! 

If the two end up beating their opponent, then it's richly deserving.

I have a feeling that Saina may do better than Sindhu. But let's hope both these wonderful women win.  A lot of athletics action is coming up from 5:10 PM. Also the quarterfinals of men's and women' team in table tennis. Dharun Ayyasamy has won the silver in men's 400m hurdles. Excellent run by him, especially in the last 50m to rob the Japanese of the silver. Sudha Singh has won the silver in women's 3000m steeplechase. She won the gold in the same event in 2014 Asian Games.  Neeraj Chopra, my man. Silver for India in women's compound archery team event after losing to South Korea in the final. 

Final score : Korea: 231 India: 228

Muskan Kirar and Madhumita Kumari failed to get their best shots as the match progressed. Although excellent shooting by Jyothi Surekha Vennam. Archery: Most bizarre rules I've ever seen. But they tried their best.  So so many Bahrain-Qatar wins in tracks. Asia doesn't even have that 5 year IOA rule. Fuck them. There was a guy who has his brother playing for Nigeria. Just read about Tejinder Pal Singh shot put gold winner . He switched from cricket to shot put. Cannot imagine that dude playing cricket now with that physique. Hima Das almost caused another disqualification with that obstruction. At this point might just call them Afro-Asian Games. The Chinese boxer was all over Vikas. But Vikas won the bout. Dutee Chand, another Silver. Damn, she is a superstar. Almost beat the ""imported"" Bahrain girl. I was severely depressed at Indian loss. I am an ardent hockey follower, and I knew Malaysia is a though but to crack. But it turned out to be reinforced concrete. It's so so disappointing.  5th straight gold in womens 4x400m. We have been winning this since 2002. Amazing! 3 medals in sailing for India today. 1 silver and 2 bronze. We have 62 medals now, 3 away from equalling our record of total medals of 65, made in 2010 Asian Games. Gcttirth gets demo bronze in hearthstone. I think we are in for another disappointment in hockey.  As squash doesn't seem to be covered I guess boxing final  is the last thing we have left to watch.(other than e sports). GOLD!  Anyone watched the hockey finals?!! What an absolute cracker of a match!! Update- Wrestling: Harpreet wins his bout against Sumi Masato 8-0, enters semis. Another medal assured for India. 

 Santosh Kumar wins bronze in Men's Sanda 56kg.

&#x200B; 15 year old Shardul Vihan wins silver in double trap shooting!  Indian hockey team defeats Japan by 8-0. Disappointing performance by India in Kabaddi and Badminton. India's future in shooting looks so good, lots of young stars are coming up. No one wants to play squash, I don't see any more stars coming up in squash after these four. Jinson Johnson bags gold in men’s 1500m  Multi medalists for India at 2018 Asian Games:
Hima Das(3), Md. Anas Yahiya(3), Jinson Johnson(2), Dutee Chand(2), Arokiarajiv(2), Dharin Ayyasamy(2), Fouaad Mirza(2), Sharath Achanta Kamal(2). Gnanasekaran though to Men's Table tennis round of 16. Had a good game against Indonesian. Today is going to be a historic day for India in its Asian Games history. Today we will surpass our previous best of a total of 65 medals at 2010 Asian Games. We can also equal our record of 15 gold medals of 1951 Asian Games today as we need only two more gold. Boxing and Sqaush is our best bet to get those two golds. And if we get three gold, then it will be our best ever Asian Games in terms of gold and total medals won. Great games for India. Thank you all for showing interest.  It was a great journey! 69, oh holy number! We have improved vastly and it would have been (it is technically) our best performance, if not for damned Bahrain and Qatar.  This was Sindhu's 5th final loss of the year...must be so frustrating to lose so many finals. I feel like she's been number 2 number 3 for the longest time and in that time a bunch of people have occupied the number 1 position and won something significant (Marin was number 1 for a while, Ratchanok was 1, Li Xuerui was 1 and now Asiad finals). I do hope she starts winning. 

&#x200B;

Nevertheless, I'm just an armchair critic who's sad at her loss and only hope that she goes up from here.  Update - Wushu: India’s Roshibina Devi Naorem has beaten Pakistan’s Mubashra in the Women’s Sanda 60kg quarter-finals.

The Iranian opponent also showed some great sportsman spirit. Gunneshwaran Prabhakaran gets bronze in Tennis men's singles. Update - Badminton: Saina Nehwal reaches quarter finals, defeating Indonesia's Fitriani.  Dipika Pallikal Karthik gets the bronze medal in Women's Squash after losing to Malaysia's Nicol Ann David. Fouaad Mirza has won the silver in Equestrian Eventing Individual. Women's compound archery team has reached the final after defeating Chinese Taipei. Finally some good new in archery for India. PV Sindhu is in the semi-final of badminton women's singles. Now 2 medals are assured in badminton for India. India need to win its tie against Iran, DPRK has already upset Japan in Group B, so if we finish 2nd behind China we would face DPRK in QFs. Update: Dutee Chand wins **silver medal** for India. Gold and Bronze medalists have difference of 0.03 seconds. What a race! Sudha singh on her way to Silver in Steeplechase.

Edit: Nope.

Double Edit: Yup. Neena Varakil is giving her everything in women's long jump to get the gold  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWfyPrlQrEo

Check out this video from 5 min onwards to know how hyperandrogenism is treated unfairly by Americans loaded IAAF. Dutee Chand fought her suspension in CAS and then came back to win like Caster Semenya. Am I mistaken in thinking CWG Delhi had good crowds than here in Indonesia especially the marquee sports of athletics arena being almost empty.

They were shooting superbly and totally deserved the gold medal.

PS: I have started to hate the Koreans as much those Iranians and bought off athletes 😂😂 It is gold and for India in men's 800m !!!! Gold to Manjit Singh and silver to Jinson Johnson. It is the best moment for India in this Asian Games. Yoyoyoyooy manjit singh! Chak de phatte! First one-two in athletics after Milkha Singh and Makkhan Singh in 1962.

 In the mixed relays, Hima ran her lap in the second lane for half the race, until she realized that there was no lane at all, and then switched to the first lane.

Dont think we would have got the gold anyway but would have been a much closer finish. Boxing: Amit Panghal is through to the semi-final and India are assured of a BRONZE medal. I have to say amateur boxing is not exciting to watch. You think this guy is winning even the commentators get it wrong , but the judges choose the other opponent. No live scoring till the end of the match. Gold for Arpinder Singh. Gold for Arpindar. Bravo! Finally we are in double digit golds Events in which India can win a medal at Day 12 (30/08/2018) :

6:30 p.m.:- Athletics [Finals - Men's 4*400 m. Relay Team and Women's 4*400 m. Relay Team] Women's 4 X 400m , Gold. Silver in men's 4 x 400m relay. A good race by the Indian athletes. Losing to those imported athletes is not a true loss in my opinion. The third lap was crucial in surpassing Japan. Also nice trigger in the last stretch. Neither any of the channels nor sonyliv are broadcasting the squash semis. Any place else? 

Edit : Women’s team are through to the final. Will either face Hong Kong or Japan Amit into finals of Boxing !  I am so pissed man. No television broadcast of squash final. Finally India's winning tons of medals in sports somewhere. Why do we do so well in the Asian games but struggle in the Olympics? Fuck those oil rich middle Eastern countries buying their way to the Athletics medals. BC...this is turning out to be choking day. We have lost almost all games today... archery 2 final losses, badminton final loss, TT semi loss, volleyball qf loss against pak...boxing started with loss in quarters for sonia... All hopes now for athletics it seems... Why wasn't the football team sent to the games? I read that it was because they were considered unlikely to win a medal. However, Vietnam, a team much behind India in the FIFA rankings, are in contention for bronze tomorrow. Even Pakistan and Bangladesh sent their teams. I don't really understand this decision, especially with the rapid traction football has been gaining lately.   Update - Gymnastics: Indian women team qualifies for the final, finishing 7th on the table. Update - Tennis: Prajnesh Gunneswaran beats South Korea's Kwon Soon-woo. A medal assured for India in Men's Singles.  Update - Squash: Dipika Pallikal beats Indonesia's Rohmah Yeni Siti 3-0 in women’s singles Round of 16.

​ Compound Men's team reaches the semis! Man these games are all so nerve-wrecking. Seemed like an easy win, but two shots of 8 and they needed a 10 to win...and he did it. So exciting. Indian men's compound archery team is also in the semi-finals. Great display of marksmanship. The ending was a bit nervous for India after they lost their comfortable 3 points lead due to two 8 point shots. But the final shot of 10 points ensured India's win with the score of 227 against Philippines' 226.  India wins brone in Bridge men's team and mixed team events. Md. Anas Ahiya wins silver in Men's 400m Santosh Kumar Tamilrasan has qualified for final of 400m hurdles. Govindan L has lost his bronze as he has been disqualified. Vey sad incident.

 Saina Nehwal gets the bronze after losing to Tai Tzuying in the semi final. She played good till 14-15 points in both the games but lost her momentum after it. WHere can i watch mens table tennis? 

Ten sports, Sony, etc is all actively discussing Dutee Chands 100m in the studio for the 100th time today. SHow us the events, goddamit! PV Sindhu has lost the gold medal by playing probably her worst final ever. Loose shots and low confidence. She needs to come out of the mental block she faces while playing in the finals. Don't know why she starts looking quite ordinary in finals compared to the earlier matches in a tournament. We got a bad beating today. No gold. Guess hockey and athletics are the only hope.  Pincky Balhara gets the silver in Kurash !! Very good performance by her to reach till the final and get the silver Fck man! I hate bahrain ..importing atheletes from africa( powerhouse in running/atheletics) ..even in women's 5000m now .
Feel like they robbed india of so many golds :-/ Fck! Another imported gold for bahrain :-/ Mixed team track event looks fun. And yet again ...robbed of a gold by Bah-fc-rain! Volleyball me I think they have bought firangis from Europe or America. Manika Batra is hot! First Indian female medallist in the history of TT So are we winning any medals today apart from Athletics? We scored 76 goals in the tournament and still not in final ffs  We beat Bahrain in track. WOMEN WIN GOLD IN 4x400m. WHAT A RACE!  All throw events in women China won gold. 4 straight golds. These throw events we have a better chance than beating African imports who even the world's best cannot beat. What is India's best rank ever in Asian Games and when? Vikas out with an injury. Lots of news reporting that he won't play his semi final and will settle for the bronze. The cut he received above his eye in the previous match is impairing his vision. Events in which India can win a medal on Day 14(01/09/2018):

1. Boxing - Men's Light Fly - Final - 12:30 PM - Gold
2. Bridge - Men's Pair - Gold Medal Match -  8:30 AM - Gold

She was very fast right from the beginning.  Jinson Johnson has qualified for the 800m final after winning the heat 1. Table Tennis Women's Team is Out in QF, they lost to Hong Kong 3-1. Hoping Men's Team can win their match. Singles will be even tougher. Indian women's TT team has lost in the quarterfinal to Hong Kong. Sindu lost first set. Fingers crossed. Hope it gets to third set. Wtf is up with sindhu? Sindhu settles for silver. She wasn't in rhythm today. Tai Tzu played phenomenal. Hats off. Badminton women's final: Happened what everyone on Reddit expected. Sindhu needs to work on her final-phobia. Boxing womens featherweight (57kg) quarterfinals 

  Sonia Lather(IND) vs jo son hwa(PKR) start ho gaya bhailog Boxing womens featherweight (57kg) quarterfinals 

Sonia Lather(IND) vs jo son hwa(PRK) 

  We lost PRK dominated all three bouts
 So looks like this is it..only hockey is gold prospect now? Or do we have more gold opportunities(Wrestling maybe?) Jinson Johnson comes in with the best time from the semis. Hope he runs the race of his life. I dont think an Indian guy won the Asiad gold in 800m since Charles Borromeo in 1982. Pinky Balhara and MY Jadhav has reached the semi finals in Kurash women's -52kg ensuring 2 bronze medals for India. Okay guys Women's heptathlon has resumed with shot put event. We are currently at number 1 and number 3 position. Dutee Chand has qualified for 200m final by winning the semifinal 1. Hopefully Hima Das will too. Hima Das has been disqualified. Wtf is happening in this race. Don't they give warning or anything? I don't know much about Kurash but one thing is sure that Uzbeks are too good in it. Pincky Balhara has reached the final in Kurash !! She has ensured a silver for the country. Great performance by the 19yo. Just came to know from the commentary that Kurash originated in Uzbekistan. Explain why the Uzbeks are so good in it. any idea why the athletics stadium is 75% empty? I thought the Asian Games is a premier event which would attract lotsa crowds.  most of the top asian athletes are competing. probably low level of interest in a country like Indonesia.  India wins silver in mixed 4x400m relay. Fuckin' African-Baharainins Is dutee chand's race left today? What events does India have a chance to win tomorrow?  Barman is first with only the 800 meters left and the second place athlete and her have identical personal bests in the 800 meters. Hembram is in 4th and probably more difficult for her to medal. Why can we let those Bahraini athletes participate? So we can buy medals now; then where's the sport I reckon. Where's the patriotism and sportsmanship?  Achanta/Manika - India's best ever in TT are up against North Korea in Mixed doubles QF. Win here will assure another historic medal in TT.  Watched yesterday's highlights.
What did happen in men compound archery team? We were almost at cusp of winning gold medal.

Neeraj Chopra is surely my star. Hoping for Olympic medal tbh. 

 Second table tennis medal confirmed in mixed doubles for the first time ever. This has been India's best games. At least a bronze for TT mixed team! Man it was a bp rising game.  TT SF : Achanta,Manika against two boys 10 golds bhai ..update the thread 😁 The direct feed commentators are so much better than the Sony ones. They don't even bother to do basic research about scoring system of the events they are covering. India lose relay appeal and squash women's team are in the semis. This Salwa Naseer from Bahrain just ran 4x100m relay and boy she was lethal. Feel for the Chinese for losing their gold to them though.

It surprising that she runs 100m, 200m and 400m  Seema Punia settles for Bronze in Discuss Throw When did the Malaysian team get so good? I'm not a regular hockey follower, but I remember so many games of India mauling Malaysia. What a gold in Women's 4X400m relay for India. Simply superb. Mens relay is more difficult..fuck... JApan ka lambu is kickass runner... and bahrain aur qatar imports toh hai hi Where is the best place to watch all the highlights? Like the womens 4x400m relay? 2 more medals in sailing - one silver and one bronze Esports semifinals is on. Glad to see india in there. Any more Golds up for grabs? One more strong gold medal prospect remaining for India today : Sqaush How come there's 3 Korea on the medal table? Anybody?  [China's humble brag not enough space in newspapers for all medal winners](http://www.espn.in/espn/story/_/id/24489130/china-asian-games-where-gold-always-good-enough) Anyone else thinks that PV Sindhu loses her nerve in any tournament final? Silver in men's .Beaten By Africa. Qatar(Africa) wins the men's 4X400. India settles for silver. Ayaz taking a dig at Boria for not knowing about Sailing,Boria with his usual overconfidence (mis)calculated all medal prospects the other day and didn't even mention sailing. Love some good banter xD Roshibina Devi wins bronze in Women's Sanda 60kg. We've come a long way from the first Olympic gold. The next olympics will definitely be the best so far Bridge mens pair gold.   

edit. so we match 15 golds. Armchair critics doing their work here it seems.
We did well this Asian games,last time was really disappointing, winning or losing is just a part of it. I don't see anyone complaining when we beat the Africans in women's 4x400 relay,which was a huge upset. Why complain now? Our women's hockey team in particular had a great game, we should appreciate it not demean them.
Only disappointment for me was men's badminton and our kabaddi performance,even there , people who had seen the last Asiad final between india and iran men's, should know that it was on the cards.

Tl;dr : a great Asian Games for india and we should be proud of our athletes.

 That shooting match in which Rajput won the silver, it was intense  [deleted] [deleted] Did India not qualify for the football event. Are they so bad in Asia too? Ankita Raina wins bronze in Tennis Women's Singles. 4 point lead for iran. 14 minutes remain. will be a massive shock if we lose. ajay thakur is all bloody and not likely to play anymore  5 point lead, 5 minutes to go. come on guys!! Olympics mein to hai hee nahi ab our one confirmed gold in the asian games is being taken away :( Update - Squash: Joshna Chinappa settles for **Bronze** after losing in the women’s semi-finals to Malaysia's Sivasangari Subramaniam.

 Update - Handball: The Indian women’s handball team defeat Malaysia 54-19 in their Classification 9th-10th Place match. Dutee Chand match link? Anyone. Please. Is there a 100m sprint? Wanna see who the fastest in Asia is. What is the progress in Womens Decathalon...last i saw barman was leading...this was after the high jump...any more updates...can't watch... India vs Pakistan in Volleyball. India is leading by 1 set to nil. It is a quarterfinal for 7-12. Men's archery team is playing at God Level. 6 out of 6 perfect 10s. Indian Archers are killing it!!

may defeat the world champions korea! Haha it's tied again.  Looks like players from other sports have left it to athletics to bring the gold medals in the seond half of this Asian Games. Swapna Barman is such a fighter. Giving her PB in shot put with a facial injury.  Tf is happwning!! Yaqoob Yaqoob. The name so nice you say it twice. A bronze and an assured silver in Kurash. Very proud moment for the athletes and the country. Mallaprabha Jadhav has won the bronze medal in Kurash. Why do Qatar and Bahrain care about medals anyway? Indian athletes in 20km walk disqualified ? Anyone know the reason ? swapna barman just threw her lifetime best over 50 meters in the javelin. She is back in the lead in the heptathlon. Crucial boxing QFs have begun... 4 Indians are in fray. Boxing has been most disappointing so far with zero medals. Why were male boxers bout without head protection but female is with ? Right, so athletic events of the day has begun... medal hopefuls - Arpindar in Triple Jump, Swapna Barman in Heptathlon, Dutee in 200m and qualifications of Manjit, Johnson in 1500 finals and Indian team in 4x400 relay...
There is also Womens hockey semi and boxer Dheeraj in QF coming up... more medal hopefuls Wasnt indian women's hockey at 4:30 today?
 Dutee Chand another silver(200m). Another silver in womens 200m thanks to Bahrain Thankfully we won 2 medals in boxing today in last leg. Hopefully they will turn it into Gold to save some face. Like Kabaddi, another disappointment this year. 
2014 - 5,
2010 - 9 Arpinder Singh is leading in men's triple jump. Uhh what? No manjit and johnson both are there 1 medal away from equaling 2014 medal tally Any events remaining for the day for India besides hockey ? Bronze in Women’s 1500m Lost to Malaysia in semi final during shoot out 6-7, Hockey men's. India lose the hockey semi-final similar story against Australia they are terrible in these shootouts. Lost to Malaysia in Men's Hockey. I was hoping for the India Pakistan final. :( Malaysia deserved to win they kept their heads throughout,going down to 9 men while ahead was utter nonsense,having said this  I don’t understand how was our first penalty even close to an obstruction. Any hope for any more gold medals? Boxing or Womens Squash? And yeah women's hockey! Bahrain won a gold + silver in 2016 olympics. Next games definitely they can get 7+ medals. Manika not able to pick the back spin of the boy. We are trailing 0 -1 in squash women's team final. Anyone know when is the final football match? I love how a lot of medals have come from athletics off late! Do you think it's because of improvement in training facilities over the last 2-3 years?  I don't know why Indian women's team is so dumb. This was a simple dumb play. Either we are dumb, or Japanese are very smart. Wasting 6 minutes allowing Japan to dribble the puck as much as they like when you are 1 goal down in the final quarter. Wow! Come on! What do you have to lose by attacking when you are 1 goal down! Yet India defended like crazy. Japan outplayed us. I am disappointed cause present Indian team has more potential. Both guys and girls. 

So no gold from hockey, yet again. I expected 2 golds considering their form and skill.  Just saw the compound women archery QF(?). What a game! They were trailing by 3 points and just before the last round it was all tied somehow. Three shots left and India got 10 on each shot! Really fun to watch.

Edit : It was the SF! They are into the finals!

That is quite a leap even for home games. What do you think is the reason ? There is clearly a gulf between Tai and other current women players. Sindhu has got more power in her smashes because of her larger stature but she isn't swift off her feet. She couldn't pick many of the drop shots she should have India out of boxing without a medal. But seriously man empty stadiums are so disappointing..can only imagine what thr atheletes must feel like :-( Op, now we are 8th. Update it please. our Table Tennis campaign ends with 2 bronze,great improvement in a world class field,Men's team and specifically Achantha did very well,room for little improvement in women's section.
All in all ,a great outing. One more gold and this will become our best ever Asian Games in terms of gold as well as overall medals. North Korea has more medals than INDIA. FTW. Man i cant get over the fact that if bahrain hadnt cheated us of golds we'd be number 5 ahead of iran at like 20 golds Gold done and dusted for the archery team  Do you need different body types for discus/hammer/shotput throw ? Never see athletes competing in both events. In swimming and track so many athletes do multiple events. Does anybody know how strong are Bahrain in women's 4x400 relay. If not for them, that's a strong gold prospect for us tomorrow. [deleted] when is manu bhaker's final?  Congratulations Anyway to watch the India v Iran Semi-Final Kabaddi match online?

 Archery game is on, at halfway point India and Korea are just one point apart.

Edit: 173 all at 18 shots. What channel is the badminton final on?  Indian men's compound archery team has a lead of 1 point after the halfway point in the match. Lmao that chutiya from philipine didnt even know how to do the eye celebration. How many more events in hepthathalon? We are 1 medal away from 50 medals. What's the next even for India? China has won 6 gold medals in throw and jump events. 4 in women's events which is much easier. When is the men's final for 1500? WTF...women hepthatlon 800m is divided into 2 heats? this is confusing...our players are in 2nd race Why is Vikas Gowda not competing?  [deleted] Girls are not really playing well in hockey semi. We gotta win this, cmon yaar. Need 2 golds in hockey. 
 Hockey semi in the shootouts, 1-1. Other than 5000m any event left for India? Anyone knows where can I watch Sharath Kamal’s round of 16? 

Edit : He lost the round of 16.  How's india men's squash semis looking? Now I know why people were pissed after France won the FIFA World Cup We need to target field events in high jump,long jump,triple jump,pole vault and throwing events to win gold medals. Difficult to beat powerhouses \s like Bahrain and Qatar in track  Hoping Manika Batra defeats all the boys to a medal. Why the fuck is this thread not stickied?

Edit: Someone stickied it now. Thankfully. And with kazak gold india gets pushed down further :-/ ALL EXCITED FOR 11:40AM GAME. Come on Sindhuuuuuuuu!!❤️ Damn! That bahrainian chic was HOT!! no 4 x 100 teams for India?

also nobody in 100, 200m for men? [deleted] [deleted] [Hong Kong Goalie](https://en.asiangames2018.id/athletes/athlete/CHAN-Hou-Fung-3027041/)

I think they put some HSBC Bank Manager as Hong Kong goalie - 57 goals in 5 games.

The industry has a long way to go and we are just seeing the initial stages here in India but it is way better to pursue the course abroad and also find a job there. No jobs for Sports management MBA in India. One of my friends did that and is now unemployed. There is a college of Symbiosis group for that, check that out if you want. I believe you will find better opportunities outside india both education and placement wise, if you have the funds for it. Anyways, do lots of research on Google and best of luck!!! A great way moving forward for you is to do an MBA where you wish to live post your MBA. With USA being the preferred destination for Sports MBA.

A large number of MBA programs abroad do however require you to have experience in the preferred field you wish to pursue your MBA in.

Look for opportunities within sports management in India or abroad. Look for certifications that might suggest to a college recruiter your inclination to pursue the same.

907,Sports,"Can't wait for Bollywood to make her biopic with Sonam Kapoor in the lead and fucking it up completely.  Source: Joy Bhattacharya on twitter. Fucking great. I was also born with twelve toes. This is where our similarities end.  Dayyyyum. Her arms are better than mine.  I am glad that non cricket sports are getting more and more female role models. One of india's biggest core problem is the gender gap in employment and this would encourage closing it.  I can't handle this. This is amazing... I saw a picture of a text book in West Bengal depicting Milkha Singh as Farhan Akhtar from Bhaag Milkha.
Times are changing in India. But they are too ducking slow. Time to honour the real heroes and patriots.
And stop helping Bollywood in creating utterly crap movies. For Ex: Sultan

Sultan doesn't show any training. Just that he falls in love and those athletes who are busting their ass since they were probably 5 yrs old are all defeated in 6 months? Dafuk?  Now I feel shitty for complaining about waking up and still being tired.. Truly inspiring.  Can we somehow donate to her or her family? What's her UPI id? [This dude too](https://youtu.be/XaEGDS_curQ?t=3m5s). I was laughing at his rather unconventional throwing stances but he ended up demolishing his competition and won gold for India. Dude is like the Hulk.  Perfect example for ""what's your excuse?"" Might be mistaken but I think her name is Swapna Barman not Burman. 

Apparently the tape was used to help with a toothache in and infected tooth that flared up at the start of the competition. It was decided to try antibiotics rather than removing the tooth mid competition.  Look at that face. Look at that body language.

Iron clad determination!  How I see it is that India does not deserve such heroines when it cannot feed them or at least provide them with the infrastructure. It is ironic to say the least and very sad that to achieve basic standard of living is a quest for the common man in India. A hero the country needs right now, but not the one it deserves I think that is not inspiring but opposite of it. Telling everyone how our country doesn't care about any sports person no matter how badly they need help or caring intervention.. Our country sux. We all should be ashamed of ourselves.. This and many such truths just points to sorry conditions and diminishes all hopes for youth aspiring to excel in sports. OP , Hero should be gender neutral.
She is my Hero. India can't afford spl shoes for her? Poor country? But can afford to send her to Jakarta ? How? Congrats Swapna Burman for her great achievement even in a time when she was in great pain  first thing I see on reddit today - immediate goose bumps. well done. Very well done. No offence, but i legit thought that bandage was some sort of  Flag. Am i the only person who read the last word as heroine? I know this isn't the point and I am happy for her achievement and what it means for our nation, but she is really hot. Those arms! * swoon * Now that's a role model girls should be looking up to. Not fucking Karina Kaif and shit. India has enough money to feed an army of incompetent bureaucrats and politician-cronies to plum sports offices with first class international travel etc., but ACTUAL sportspeople and their families will live in poverty. The Sports Ministry expects impoverished people to win medals on their own grit, claims credit for when they actually do, and then goes back to its sarkari routine of incompetence, apathy, and neglect of actual sport.  If only we could treat our sportsman/ woman as we treat our cows, we could we winning Olympic medals by boatloads but knowing our government and its cronies hey would rather apply to make COW Safety a Olympics game rather. Daughters of India are making us proud big time. Hope they get good recognition and awards for their sacrifice None of the other nations are that surprised that women from India can run really fast. Hail mother india !! ⛹️🤼🏊🚴🤾️ This is the story of the entire Indian economy.  The Indian Government fucking people in the ass till they can barely walk, and then the people persevering and triumphing somehow, and then the Minister arrives and places a garland on them and puts articles in the paper so the country looks good.  


If you want to know how full of behanchods the government is, just see how the sports bureaucrats travel and their baggage allowance, and then see how the athletes travel and their allowance.  


Or if you want to feel your gut wrench at the limits of disgust, examine how the sports budget is spent in terms of funds and facilities for athletes versus salaries, benefits, offices, and allowances for the bureaucrats.  


Every time an injured veteran is working some menial job to make ends meet or an athlete is begging around town for sponsors just to get fresh fruits and meat for their diet, Indians should protest.  Because, believe me, Indian Government has allocated enough funds to develop sportsmen and sportswomen in India ... but those funds are being used to employ and benefit behanchods in the bureaucracy instead. Sometimes I feel the country doesn't deserve her. Talents like her are nurtured and groomed in other countries. I know I shouldn't be complaining and working towards it. I normally do. Today is not that kind of day. Pardon me. Proud of her. Feminism aside... Why is her face held together by tape?  Big deal! Hritihk Roshan has 2 thumbs in one hand and still managed to do that dance step! She's an Inspiration for future athletes. My girl!❤️ you go gurl Amazing !

I hope Swapna gets some brand endorsements, her story is incredible.  We don't deserve her.  Fuck yeah, this woman probably works harder than any of us can begin to comprehend Where can I see her actual performance? I can’t believe the amount of spam videos with slideshows when i google her name!  India doesn't deserve such relentless sportspersons. Sad but true. This should be before she got to Indian team. Typical of Bollywood, let some unknown win some shit and then the Bollywood vultures circle around to make monies and ride to fame Correct me if I am wrong but I've noticed that all of Indian sportspersons are either from quite wealthy families or from very poor families like in this case. The salaried middle class never produces top class athletes. What can be the reason behind this?

Don't see anything wrong with his statement. 1 star to Lewis Hamilton in F1 2018 That poor image helps Hollywood directors get a Oscar. He's right. Not only is India poor but it has no racing tradition of the F1 variety. It's wholly imported, just like everything else. Really glad to see some sense being spoken for a change. When she says 'I want you to go away' but you only hear 'I want you '. I kinda wish we taught people a crash course on inequality and diplomacy. Hosting things like this is part of a country’s soft power export. 
When 2008 Beijing olympics happened, China wasn’t as powerful as it is today and a lot of its population was poor. Even if only 1% of a country is interested in things like this, that’s a whooping 14 million people for countries like China and India.

This is going to be an unpopular opinion because I know there are a lot of Hamilton and F1 fans in India (/s) and a lot of India-bashers. But here's what I have to say:

To me, whenever a westerner calls India poor, it evokes the same feeling like a thief calling you poor after robbing your house. The western education conveniently distorts world history and doesn't account for the centuries of loot that they are still feeding on. They built Suez Canal precisely to loot India and had thousands of huge ships taking away India's wealth into England. In fact, their media constantly talks about India's poverty to subconsciously (or consciously) justify the endeavors of their forefathers in India. Even Indian history books don't talk anything about the quantum of this loot, which creates a self-bashing brigade. 

Alright, this excuse has been overused, but it doesn't make it any less of a fact. 

Today, the rate at which India is growing, you'll see lots of westerners standing in the Indian work-permit lines within a decade. The tables are going to turn again. A lot of these ignorant tarts will need to reflect on what they said a decade ago.

Our minds make things so much more complicated. I was diagnosed with Hypo-thyroid and I put on weight massively, which mean I was looking much less nicer than I did earlier. I developed inferior complexity of people making fun of me, having opinions about how I looked, to an extent that some people who were my friends were not willing to include me in any activity we did otherwise anymore. I was devastated.

Eventually, I realized whether you are short or tall, skinny or obese, people will look at you and make fun of you. You can't change that and no one will ever give a damn. What matters is that you chose to make a difference and work towards making yourself healthy. If you're not comfortable in the current gym, find another. When you begin talking about the costs, tell them that people have highly recommended the gym and you expect a concession. Be confident, people will look but if you're confident about yourself, they will look in awe too. Keep your vibe high. Wear things you like as long as they aren't over the board. You're beautiful, others don't have to tell you that, you should know that yourself.

A cheaper but well strung racquet will be much better than a higher model with improper tension and small sweet spot.

My advice will be to spare 300-400 after purchase and then practice with it for a week or so.  If the sweet spot doesnt feel natural then, get [this](https://www.amazon.in/Yonex-Badminton-Strings-BG-0-70mm/dp/B00JP4R0BO) strung, BG 65 is the best for beginners and advanced players alike.

> My order was picked up and the delivery guy ran away with it

> This is the truth

I'm sure you would have said something similar in the Zomato review, and that is why your review was removed. Ordered Dry Manchurian from Zomato. Received fried onions. Called the restaurant & he said ""Sir, manchurian khatam ho gaya tha!"" Messaged Zomato Support. Initially said no for refund. After 15 minutes of my asking to call me or transfer to somebody senior, gave me a refund. Actually this might have gotten Zomato in legal trouble(even though they would easily win, they don't even want to take chances of litigation). You claimed  (i believe you personally) that the restaurant committed a crime so that can have serious legal consequences. My restaurant consistently gets 4 or 5 star ratings on Zomato, and still our rating shows as 3.7 on the site. Super buggy, super rigged even for restaurants. Allegations are bad stuff on reputation based systems.

When it’s an information/social system it’s worse. Either it’s too easy to mass produce allegations and destroy competitors, or it’s too easy to generate reviews and game the system.

To stop this, people end up watching their review pages like hawks, and clean up anything they can, in any way they can. There was no delivery guy. The restaurant made an empty claim and you hallucinated that there was a delivery guy. What I understand is you didn't see the delivery guy ran off but he did mark the delivery as fulfilled. You should be writing the events as you saw in app. Not infer that the agent ran away. It becomes a bold allegation and hence removed. 

The restaurant is certainly at fault for the failure, maybe their modus operandi. But your allegations are definitely unsubstantiated. Please write to us the review, maybe censor any privacy-related names of the restaurant and your locality.

Also, the review on Zomato seems as if it was removed by Zomato, not the Restaurant. Try sending the review again. Shukr manao biwi ke saath nahi bhaaga How do you know it an employee of the restaurant?.

Can you actually prove that someone from the restaurant stole your food?.

Unless and until you have solid proof, it is an allegation. 

Zomato is right is removing your allegation. 

You can't go around throwing claims you cant prove on their website. 

The business can sue Zomato for causing a ""loss of reputation"". Rewrite review. Take screenshot of that and this and post it on twitter tagging zomato. Zomato has been manipulating reviews, ratings and listings since a while now. 

Quite a few top reviewers and regular members are paid / given perks to shape a review a particular way.

I deleted my account few months ago on Zomato when they were hacked. Never trusted them. Never liked them. I am more than happy to post my own reviews on Google Maps. In which city/town is this? Asking because I am an avid Zomato user so I like tracking its service. Edit 1: I tried to write the review for the order and it says that the order wasn’t serviced by Zomato and hence refund has been initiated. Which means I’m no longer allowed to review an order which I officially haven’t been served. Almost reminds of chicken and egg story. I want to write a review because I didn’t get the order delivered. In my original review I had even praised Zomato for initiating the refund immediately. Edit 2: https://imgur.com/gallery/AH9qSqg

919,Food,"Our immune responses are different from theirs. Moreover, genetics is a great factor that helps us. 

If you introduce children early on (till about 5 years) to allergenic foods, their chances of developing allergy later is reduced.

I'm no expert, do correct me if I'm wrong. Bhai Yahaan jise jo milta hai woh kha lete hain There are way less autoimmune here as well. Read hygeine hypothesis or biome theory. Mostly cause of the conditions a baby is brought up in. 

Americans do spend a lot of time wiping surfaces with antibacterial wipes and stuff, making the child less immune.

Don't really need to explain our case Hum Gareeb desh hain. Yeh sab allergies are first-world issues! >Is it due to lack of awareness or something else?   

lack of awareness does not cause allergies.    

Indians breathe in dirty air, drink dirty water, eat roadside food that's made with unhygienic stuff with unclean hands, there's utter lack of sense of hygiene here. those plastic disposable gloves you see at restaurants: those are namesake. staff scratch their hair, and whatnot while wearing the same gloves. they are just to keep their hands clean. not to keep our food clean.  we do not have allergies coz we are used to these things. we do not get loose toos after eating street food coz our bodies are immune to those germs.   
have you seen friends / relatives that were eating all filthy roadside food here, and then stayed abroad for 18months and come back for a visit , eat idli sambar and get diarrhea ? coz their immune system has gone weak thanks to the sterile environment in Amrikka. Because Indians have been eating all kinds of potentially allergic food since time immemorial, and natural selection has done  what it does best. The thing that does not kill you only  makes you stronger. I'm allergic to shellfish. Indians are least fussy about this. The only thing you will get warnings about is egg and meat. Maybe because some allergies are hereditary. They are too damn clean. Children aren’t supposed to grow in a sanitized environment. I'm allergic to eggs😕 I remember reading a study where they proposed this theory that unsanitary conditions during childhood actually helps in preventing these allergies. They proved some link between gut bacteria and the allergies I think. Can't find it now. Indians have become mutant, immune to Farzi diseases like allergies. 30 percent Indians are lactose intolerant 

People don't know what they are allergic of Can't just be awareness. If you're not aware of your peanut allergy you become aware in a hurry. Maybe children not raised in a clinically clean environment get less allergies? I have a notion, but because large agricultural companies often pay for the ""science"" to verify the safety of their products and work hard to silence those who disagree, this is difficult to prove. However, I'm of the belief that the increasing pesticides and GMOs adversely affect gut health tied to allergy issues. The most common allergens are tied to industries with the most pesticides: corn, wheat, soy, and peanuts, to name a few. Food allergies were not that widespread in America, and it's only been on the uptick coincidentally around the same time as the higher prevalence of GMOs and heavy pesticides. Agriculture was nowhere near consolidated in the hands of a few as it is today. 

&#x200B;

It kinda makes sense because GMO foods and pesticides are both designed with the goal of rupturing an insect's stomach. Given the genetic similarities between humans and even the lowly fruitfly, I don't know how we can all be surprised that humans experience food allergies, IBS, leaky gut, and a number of other problems from eating the same foods designed to kill insects. Americans eat allot of processed foods. Also there is an over reliance on drugs... allergy is reaction of body that is fighting something it deems risky for your immune system.

Indians generally eat everything from a very early age. so our body gets used to all kind of stuff and also the hygiene angle comes in. Our immune gets used to some germs. We are immune but our next generation might face it. Thanks to our new fad diet and water. There is a theory that when peanut allergies started showing up in america the doctors advised pregnant women to stop eating all kinds of nuts immediately.

Years later it was observed that nut allergies suddenly grew disproportionatly. 

Also a large number of allergy cases can be minimised and eradicated with continuous controlled exposure.

We have a central prison in our district. Their chappatis are so popular (and cheap) we place bulk orders for parties and marriage functions. This reminds of the days back when I was in my hometown. There's a central prison in it and its prisoners used to grow vegetables and sell them to the general public. A real ""Kaidi Kitchen"" For those who are concerned with profiteering.

The money goes back to the upkeep and expansion of the kitchen, ingredients, and wages to the prisoners. The wages are quite low around 100 Rs per day IIRC and for good reason. They have been doing it for more than a decade I think. In Trivandrum at first, they used to send vans to places around the city where the policemen would sell food packets. Usual spots would be around Government hospitals. They expanded the program to start vegetable farms and poultry farms within the jail. They also started a restaurant next to the prison, which is very popular. This is just an extension of services since Swiggy and Ubereats have expanded rapidly in Kerala. Huh. The more you know.

(My bday is not in July. Or anywhere nearby. Just recalling) Last night in Goa! What a premium grown up trip I had! So I am going through arrange marriage process and I will use this thread to post my daily updates, if that is okay.

I am 30, M. I work in IT. Never had a GF. Two years ago, I was deeply infatuated with a close friend of mine and she said no when I expressed my feelings. I was depressed for a while, but somehow got better. I still have my bad days. But, from that point on I have become socially awkward. I can't hold a conversation, properly at all. Sometimes, I go blank and I don't know what to say. This never used to happen with me earlier!

Signed up on Matrimony sites and I got soooo many matches/interests. That actually felt good, lol. 

So I was talking with a girl, my first match and turns out she uses reddit too. We had a nice convo around for an hour and that was the longest convo I could have, after that incident. Come next day, I was not able to talk at all. I was able to see that she was putting effort and trying to make better for me. But, for how long? Next day I messaged her, but same stuff. I apologised to her and lied her this is not working for some reason. This was 3 months back. 

Next stories / meetups have also been same. But I will tell them about later! Finally going for further education after a year and half. Looking forward to this! Going to sleep, fuck you all. Yesterday i learnt that if somebody compliments you, you compliment them back and never pop medicines without prescription. Any good vape eliquid websites ? 
And good eliquid which you are aware of ? Goodnight and kiss to u/ssj_cule College 1st year is going to start from next month, hope I can have fun.

In the last seat, the last window [behind the last woman reserved seat] i saw a girl and a boy. Barely 4-5 years younger than me [say first second year of college]. In that packed bus i saw the the boy bending slightly to the front and turn to the girl and go in and the girl reciprocated and landed a kiss on the boy's lips. Then the boy went further low and landed a kiss on the girls left boob. All this within 2 seconds. 

I laughed slightly at the young kids' experience of love but just then fear grasped me. What if anyone else saw? What if other other people grab hold of them and start beating them? I know Kolkata is not an idiotic cow belt city but even here sometimes these arent accepted by the old farts [remember the couple beaten in Kolkata Metro last year?]

I then questioned the very point of India, where people cant even live and love without fear.

If any family wishes to have more than child, they should be ready to pay 2x taxes just to balance out the pressure they might put on the resources.

Can you explain why restaurants are bearing the discount that Zomato is giving, when Zomato is supposed to bear the discount provided by them? Update
 Some of you have some common questions which I will answer

As for source simply call Zomato ask them you want to sign with them what's the contract they offer it. Will not be below 25% 

People saying without them I would not have orders that far its true but I before they started their own delivery (Zomato) my boys would go 7-8 kilometers for even a order worth 160  Zomato use to be a website to look for restaurants you could not order my boys since. Then have been going for 7-8. Kilometers 

Lastly to end this topic Zomato is soon making a place where you would have to buy your raw. Materials from them only which is known as hyperpure which. Will become mandatory to buy from according to my account manager if we want to work with them even Swiggy is buying. Spaces taking restaurants. Under that space and selling the restaurants item under Swiggys name  as someone who's been  in the industry for 12. Years you can choose to believe me or the company but if it continues the way it is many for your favorite places will shutdown thanks guys for hearing me out its been a tough year for restaurants ! > Tldr- Zomato Swiggy uber cheat the restaurants and you as the customer share this !

Cheating is strong word. They aren't cheating anyone but a lot of their business practice is outright predatory. 

Don't restuarant owners have unions? If not, you guys should unionize and negotiate better deals with these companies. In Zomato and Swiggy's war for customerbase, small businesses suffer. It's the same thing with Uber taxis; they scam the taxi drivers by charging large commissions off an already low taxi fare. Also restaurant owners send half filled boxes when people apply such discounts to make up the loss, so you both are riding the same boat. 

I'hv noticed this numerous times in different cities, try vising the restaurant and getting parcel in person, you'll notice they'll use smaller sized packages while sending food via zomato. OP, let me tell you how to solve this problem but you'll have to become a little tech savvy for that! 

In Pune, there is a restaurant called ""Behrouz Biryani"" who were facing similar problem as yours, let me tell you how they solved it. I used to order biryani from there through Zomato. When I repeatedly ordered biryani about 4-5 times, they texted me a special offer: If I purchased through **their** app in the Play Store (instead of Zomato), they'll give me an additional whopping 20% discount compared to the present price!

I figured out they must be facing the same issue as yours. Zomato, the middle man must be eating all their profits through discounts and delivery charges but if they (Behrouz Biryani) had their own app in the Play Store, people will order directly from there and they can be offered a much better price now. They'll have to arrange logistics but it should be trivial if you are running an established restaurant for a long time.

Try that OP, app development is not that difficult these days. Catch a trustworthy techie and either he'll code it himself for you, or he'll know a freelancer friend who'll do it. The future belongs to those who know how to ace the technological race. We know. Most of us still order for the convenience. The argument put forth could be that Zomato/Swiggy are bringing you new customers that would otherwise never visit your restaurant in person, and so any business is good business, no matter how small the margins may be.

However, on further thinking, the food app economy is killing the ""lets go out for dinner"" economy. So less customers over time will choose to visit your restaurant and prefer ordering online, which will cut into your normal profits, and limit your ability to maintain rent/electric etc costs of running a physical restaurant.

I think the end-game is to have every outlet on Zomato/Swiggy eventually turn into a kitchen-front only, working on minimal margins, with the 'middle-man' taking most of the profit, just for providing what used to be a free service (Menus + calling restaurants for delivery). Similar findings could be made in the Uber/Ola economy etc. 

Sad, but this is late stage capitalism at work. Please stop supporting Zomato. I was at a roll stall yesterday and I asked the seller about how Zomato earns as a middleman-service when you're the one charging for service and the customer is paying to you. He explained it to me and I was like, ""So how does it benefit you if they charge you money?"". He said, ""They bring us work."". I was like, ""Do they?"". And he responded, ""No, not really. We're making the same as before, except now Zomato takes away a portion of our earnings."" Hi OP, a quick question for you.

Let's say you're selling a burger via swiggy for 140 (MRP)
If I were to eat at your restaurant, will I be charged the same? What's the cost of an in-store customer versus one who orders via Swiggy or Zomato? If I order online, you save money you otherwise incur on sitting space, electricity, waiter charges, etc..

Don't you think when you account for all this, the money you lose to commissions and discounts on Swiggy/Zomato is same as what you would incur on an in-store customer? The business model is based on optimistic high volume sales.

Yes i believe this stupid 30% 10% loss bearing system should go away. But this model also gets you a higher number of orders, which otherwise you were supposed to rely on your loyal customers.
So if you were selling 10 burgers to your ""loyal"" customers and were earning 10 ₹ per burger.
Not you're obviously selling atleast 20+ burgers at maybe 5₹ profit, plus the customers who walk into your restaurant.

And moreover, its consistent earning. Its a win win situation, if there is a better loss bearing system. 

And restaurant owners also send stale, unedible, low quantity, half orders etc food which on our complaint zomato bears the refund cost. So, i dont think its only zomato's fault if people keep looking to earn money by fraud methods. Which part is a scam and how are they cheating the customer? Is it the commission they charge you or the discount which is passed on to the clients or the delivery fee they are charging?

I am sorry if this comes across as rude but if you are setting up a business relying on a 3rd party to drive orders then you can't say they are scamming you if you don't make as much money as them. A restaurant near my place stuck to their guns and had their own delivery service. They are doing quite well. If there's a restaurant union near your place, pool in some money and start your own online delivery service. You don't need stuff like fancy GPS tracking systems. A good payment gateway and order delivering on time will suffice. I often order food online (Swiggy) and the shit they pull off with the discounts is outright shady. They'll inflate the prices, give discount and bring the total bill to the same price as it was earlier. 

Also, I was at this restaurant a few days ago. I frequently order chicken 65 from this restaurant which is priced around 170 (if you buy directly from the restaurant) and 210 (if you order from Swiggy), so what I've realized is that Swiggy not only inflates the prices but also adds taxes, packaging charges, and delivery charges which knocks up the price to almost 250 which makes no sense. I used to work at an F&B SaaS company/startup. They make website for the restaurant (with their branding and theme and all), where customer can directly place the order (Restaurant get better margin, and they can offer reasonable discount). 

The competition of Swiggy and Zomato had really killed the business from their website almost for most of the clients.

&#x200B;

Burger King used to run a lot of discount on their website, but had dropped their website for ordering completely. Indian mentality is cheap and wants discounts everywhere. 

I will legitimately give more money to apps to click and order instead of talking on the phone for ordering and haggling with the delivery person for change. Tell me straightforward.

What is the % net margin on your business? Can you put together more facts and figures  to help use understand the issue ?

Also, doesnt these apps increase the number of orders for your restaurant ? How do you factor that in ? Huh, for a year now I've been noticing that a plate of Mutton Biryani from well-known and popular joints, here in Chennai (like Buhari, Dindigul Thalapakatti etc...) have priced it around Rs.270-290 or so. Prior to that it used to be around the Rs. 180-220 range (depending on the restaurant). Sure, the prices of other dishes might have obviously been hiked too, but as for now, this is what's coming in my mind.

Is the increase in price have to do with what OP has posted here? Or is it just normal and typical (due to inflation and all) and I'm just overstating things here? 

But, (nearly) 300rs for a plate of Mutton Biryani is just ridiculous, especially for the portion size that is provided to us, imo. Do you think going for a online only restaurant might help reduce your costs. You will be able to rent some small space for just the kitchen, and it doesn't have to be in the main road.

I remember reading that these type have kitchens have started becoming popular in US. Are there such kitchens operating in India now. Guess it’s Uber Cheats Just curious, do u prepare Zomato/Swiggy/Uber Eats orders differently from when a customer orders directly from you or eats in your restaurant? Thanks op. I have heard that now they are opening their own kitchen , they would make high selling food items which are high in demands , its brilliant not having to maintain a shop and just a kitchen when can be at a strategic place in city and on whatever place or floor they want and i have heard they are going to recommend their own Kitchen food since it would be tremendously cheaper since absolutely no or minimal working cost is associated with it , but this is very unjust for all the restaurant business owners because they will finally lose those who actually started using the platform because of the restraunts customers and they certainly can't compete in terms of cost to an outlet specially​ enhanced for online order . Its clearly very Injustice to everyone I may be late to comment on this but I after with OP that zomato earns around 100rs per order . According to one calculation of mine at my local Chinese food stall zomato was earning 40% apart from delivery charges and all. Some restaurants in my area are not on zomato or swiggy they are old restaurants and they get a decent footfall from their loyal customers. 

One restaurant/dhaba I used to go frequently. Bcos of good food and fast service was almost empty in what used to be a rush hour. Out side of it was a number of delivery boys waiting for the orders. I feel people coming to restaurants was more profitable for restaurants then people ordering. I always wondered who is paying the discount % to the restaurant


I noticed the price hike as well, earlier the price of jeera rice was 150, after a week or 2 it hiked to 230

I was like why 

Ur post made it all clear thanks op Instead of crying wolf, have you thought of quitting from zomato or swiggy? That way you don't need to worry about being cheated. u/Bluebaleno damn my mom was right all long, good that she forces me to get up my lazy ass and go to the restaurant from where I want the food. Never actually thought about the restaurant owners. I’ve also noticed that there’s a discrepancy in the prices quoted in the Zomato/Swiggy apps & those quoted on the actual menus in the restaurant. The prices on the app are higher by at least 20 rupees for almost every item. With all the major food delivery apps ZOMATO, UberEats and Swiggy are all operating at a loss. So, I think only the consumers are winning. It's not a 'scam'. It's called the market. These apps can charge whatever margin they want. If you don't like you can order from an alternative.

It's not like there is some law fixing food prices on Zomato. Just being the devil's advocate here for what OP mentions. What's a sustainable business model for them? bare in mind these are not just the only costs.

\- Personnel cost  this includes the tech people(paid premium packages given that the scale is huge) and the delivery

\- Operating server costs (No ordinary stuff considering the reliability and availability requirements of such a massive business)

\- Payment gateway fees(usually \~4% maybe slightly lower due to their scale.)

\- Losses ruled in favor of the  customer.- Making up for the discount's offered to lure more consumer base especially fickle consumers in India and advertising.

Its naive to just look at it from an end consumer perspective. Anyone whose run an online business must know how much money is spent on the intangibles. I personally understand when consumers/stakeholders like OP post this but their expectations are ignorant at times if not inconsiderate.  


Having said that I do not like the discount being forced down your throat OP, OP could you confirm if there is an opt out of such discount for you guys?  


PS: I've worked for quite a few startups under the e-commerce umbrella as a tech guy, such margins are norm. TIL that corporations are sleazy. Imagine that! FML! Have you imagined that without zomato or swiggy you couldn't sell the burger in the first place! No one will travel 5km for a burger!

There no concept called ""potential sale"". Without food delivery service you can't even sell the burger. Very difficult to read and understand your post man. But Delivery companies will obviously charge you,  they are delivering your food to the costumer plus they are providing you a platform to get discovered by more and more people.

The only issue I can see here is the forced discount thing because they app is providing/claiming discount not the restaurant , so apps should give discount from their pocket . Can someone please explain me this properly? I think you people should try forming some kind of unions. So Zomato and Swiggy have no one to get food from and they are forced to treat you guys better. Upvoting for better reach. If you can't afford then why don't you stop the promotion/discount? I bet no app put gun on your head. You could say no to discount. The model the apps are running are not sustainable as of now, I know. We all know these details. I heard some south Indian state is going to take action. See if you could help in the cause. PS: 230 for a burger? Damn.  That's too expensive for me. I'm a broke ass students so I wouldn't know what it's like to eat 230 RS burger. Even the zinger is 140ish something I guess. Do restaurants prepare higher quality food for non discounted over the phone orders? The places I used to order from a couple of years ago delivered great food although at higher prices. Now when I order through apps I've noticed even though the bill is cheaper the quality is not at par in a lot of places. Is this done by restaurants to try to keep up with the discounts? Thanks for sharing. Really appreciate your experience in this. I don't fully understand your problem with the delivery charge though — isn't that a part of their expenses? We as customers should pay some amount for it, right?

Also, I hope you don't mind but it's a little difficult to understand your post. As you mentioned, this isn't your first language and I truly respect your effort in trying to inform us on this important issues.

Here's how I would edit your post, if it helps, try seeing what I've cut out. Will help you write clearer the next time.

*""Hi, I own a restaurant and I just wanted to bring something to light. This is the reason why your food is expensive.*

*Companies like Swiggy, Zomato and Uber Eats charge us restaurants a 25 per cent commission on every order we get. For example, a burger sells for Rs. 250. Minus the commission, it is Rs. 200.* 

*On top of that, their discounts end up killing restaurants and bring the value down even further for us. For example, Zomato's 40-per cent discount of Zomato will cost me Rs. 50-70 rupees on the same burger, which I would end up selling for Rs.130. On top of that is a 5 per cent GST.*

*This unethical behaviour is killing restaurants and local businesses.*

*2) They charge you the customer a MASSIVE 25-35 rupees for delivery per order. Zomato earns almost 100 rupees from you and I. I understand it's a business model, but you need profits and the discounts that they are running will shut us down. Your favourite small time businesses will shut down very soon if this continues.*

*TL;DR:  Zomato, Swiggy, Uber Eats cheat restaurants and customers with their pricing and discount schemes.*

*I apologize for the way I have written as English is not my first language. It's actually one of the few times I've written in English, and that too, on such a long topic. Hope you understand!""* Always knew there has to be something behind those crazy discounts. Looks like the restaurant is being fucked over by the Companies. You get orders because of Zomato. Zomato has the right to enter into arrangement with you and it is up to you to accept or not.

Don't understand the issue here. It seems like you just want to make more money while having the  same volume as you get through Zomato. Can't have it both ways. In a free market economy, fairness in competition is touted to be the usp. In reality, it is the market itself that makes profit while the long tail of market participants die. Those that survive are usually owned by the market itself.

For e.g. if you're swiggy, the bowl company (owned by swiggy) belongs to the top 5% and brings in much more revenue than the entire long tail combined causing them to shut down. Similar with Amazon's brands like solimo etc.

In essence, this is anti competitive and would have resulted in the government to intervene, had it been some other country. The only real force stopping anti competitive practices is legislation, which our country is pissant at. I live in Singapore, I'm not sure about the markets here, but what happens there is that the sellers increase the price of the items available on the apps. You can get the same thing for about 70% the cost if you buy it directly from the restaurant. Can confirm. 22-25% of revenue goes to Zomato Swiggy. Jacking up prices to list therefore is inevitable. Good business opportunity to help small restaurants set up mobile optimized store fronts and bypass swiggy or tomato As a restaurant owner what changes would you like to see?  
Any proposal on how to let the such companies earn also?  
If the company didn't offer delivery but, just listed your menu will you get into an agreement with them? I have absolutely no problem with this.Those delivery orders would never be available for you without those apps.You will be serving to the same customer base and delivery to same people who order and live with in 10-15 minutes of your restaurant.

While I have no doubt the food apps engage in some scummy behavior and strong arm restaurants, restaurateurs need to realize that extra delivery business orders that they generate will not be available for them without these apps.How you choose to deal with that is their prerogative.

I wont order from a restaurant that is pretty far away from my location unless its through the food delivery apps.My business will be limited to nearby restaurants.Its the delivery apps that enable restaurants to get orders from outside their normal circle.You cant expect to get maximum profit from these. > 25% commission + 40% discount + 5% GST

Increase the price of the burger then. And learn some business tactics or economics. Hiking the price then offering a discount gives you more sales than offering the product at the original price.  

You have a hiked up price, which gives you a higher profit margin. Use the margin to offer discounts in your own app (if you have one), or for dine-in customers via Dineout/Zomato Gold.

Discounts have the psycological effect of reducing the price to the customer (despite the overall cost being the same) as well as free marketing (on Zomato/Swiggy and even for dine-in on Dineout/Zomato)

The 25% commission probably includes the charges of card payments (2-3%) as well as the GST on their services provided to you.  

> They charge you the customer a MASSIVE 35 to 25 rupee for the delivery per order Zomato is earning almost 100 ruppes from you and me I understand its a business you need profits but the discounts they are running will shut. Your favourite. Small time businesses very soon

I am never charged above 20 usually. With Swiggy delivery is free due to Swiggy Super. When ordering food, I do not account for delivery charges in Swiggy - because they are discounting the delivery charges. They discount the delivery charges because they get the revenue from your commissions. If the delivery charges are high, I am not going to order at all. I am ordering from restaurants 30-40 minutes away from my home that would never deliver to my area.    

Local restaurants in my area simply build up loyal customers and then stop offering discounts. I know food stalls that are running for years due to Zomato/Swiggy.

> Zomato Swiggy uber cheat the restaurants and you as the customer share this !

No, they provide convenience to the customer that even big companies like McDonalds, Pizza Hut, KFC or Domino's fail to provide.  

Develop your own app that is not crap, and support all payment methods, then I'll consider moving off Swiggy or Zomato. Searching for a restaurant, and clicking order (payment is set up already) takes less than 1 minute for me.  

Box8 (Box8, Mojo Pizza and other brands), Faasos (Faasos, Firangi Bake, Ovenstory Pizza, Sweet Tooth, Behrouz Biryani), Charcoal Eats (Charcoal Biryani, Chilli Flakes Pizza) all have their own apps that work well and offer more discounts than Zomato/Swiggy - so I use their apps when ordering from them. But they also spend on marketing and IT infrastructure. I also run a restaurant. And I'm partnering with these guys to deliver food. But when I think, it's a must for them to charge this rate of commission to run their business and still be profitable. 
If a person orders 100₹ worth food, the delivery person gets to waste about 30-45 mins of his time and travel few kilometres. Who would do it for 25₹-30₹? Customers who order through these apps don’t sit in your restaurant, don’t consume time and effort of your servers, your air conditioning or water. So if you have to pay a percentage to these apps which you save on overheads what exactly is unfair? 

The problem is you want to make the same money whether it’s an online customer or an offline one. These apps help you scale your business and without them you can simply operate as you always have, but you know that would be a lost opportunity. Restaurants in my city already raise their rates on Zomato for every dish. So business is booming for them instead of them going out of business. Customer has to pay more to get it delivered, and it's fair IMO. Zomato cancelled my order 30 minutes after ordering saying that the restaurant was closed. I lost 100 rs. worth coupon and they said that they would 'try' delivering the next order quicker. worst app for food delivery. Period. Man, this is wrong on so many levels. You can take them to court. I just got out of law school. Give me sometime, the least I can do is give you some preliminary legal advice. Why are fast food(burgers, pizza etc) prices the same in the US and in India? A McDonald's burger in the US costs $3, and burgers here sometimes cost more than that! I think you should stop whining. You are free to stop working with zomato and Swiggy, you just prefer working with them because they bring you orders.

Hi I own a restaurant and I just wanted to bring it to light to all of you. That your food is expensive because. Of these. Companies they charge Us a 25 percent commission on every order we get for eg  a burger for 250 minus commission  is 200 on top of that these restaurant ending discounts brings the value down even further for eg. The 40 percent discount  of Zomato is running will cost. Me another 50-70 rupees I would end up selling the burger for  130 and then there is 5 percent gst too this unethical behavior is killing restaurants And local businesses

Last edit - I do not run a burger place :p I own a south Indian chain but the example of a burgers was a rough example to make you guys understand !",Just had Indian food for the first time. I am speechless.
928,Food,"Personally I'm a non Indian who loves all things India. I'm a mostly white girl from Indiana. (no relation, lolol)

I love both butter chicken, which I think you had, and chicken tikka masala.  Those are great easy starters. A biryani is a meat mixed with rice dish. Unless it says veggie biryani lol. 

Tarka dal (various spellings) is delicious, that's a lentil dish.  Any dal is a lentil dish, those are staples and there are a million kinds but a few classics. Chana means chick pea.  there are ""saag""  dishes, these are greens. Spinach, etc. If it says aloo that means potato. Paneer is a kind of un-aged cheese, like queso blanco. Something described as pakora will be fried. 

Then there are all the pickles and chutneys. 

Most things will be richly flavorful but they don't have to be spicy the way a lot of people think about that word.

Edit: thanks for all the love on this comment. You guys are great. 

I'm going to admit some cultural appropriation here. I have a tattoo that is an Indian saying written in Sanskrit. It was r/India who helped me decide the best way to write it, and what you guys came up with makes it a paradox, which I love. It reads both ""a garland in a monkey's hand"" and ""a garland in Lord Vishnu's hand"". I got it as an homage to my love of India and as a reminder to myself to not be the monkey OR the garland. To be a good steward of the delicate and the vulnerable both in myself and in others. 

To those who might take offense that I did that, I am sorry. I know it's kind of gauche but I love my tattoo & get compliments on it almost daily--there are flowers around it, specific flowers with specific meanings, and it's done in a henna kind of style. Thus far, no one has told me that it actually says ""waiting for the number six bus"" so I'm hoping it doesn't... There's a high chance you just tried India's greatest gift to the culinary world - butter chicken. 

What you should order tomorrow really depends on what kind of flavours you like. Since you're just exploring, try the chicken tikka masala, and pair it up with a couple of naans of your choice. Did you buy WinRAR license? Hi OP ! There is a sub dedicated to r/IndianFood if you want to dive deeper. And you might get more nuanced suggestions there.  Also my choice from your list would be the 'Methi CHicken' as it will be completely different from what you tried yesterday(probably CHicken tikka masala. Ha-ha, welcome to your lifelong addiction my friend-take it from one who knows, once you pop, you just can't stop. I'm a 51 year old white guy from a provincial town in the UK. My first experience was aged 15 in an Indian corner shop called 'Johals' in my hometown. Knew the guys in there fairly well to talk to. Went in one day for milk and spotted a box of triangular pastries on the counter..

""What are those Mr Johal?"" 

""They're samosas RajBandar"" 

""What's a surmiser?"" 

""Samosa. They're nice, try one, free of charge"" 

I thanked him & walked out of the shop. Went up the road munching it, and despite the *tiny* amount of chilli inside blowing my head into orbit & making my eyes and nose pour,(I'd never tasted chili before this)  I'll never forget biting down on a freshly roasted cumin seed and letting that floral, earthy flavour bomb detonate and dance across my tastebuds. Twenty five years later I got on a plane at Heathrow for Delhi. In a happy miracle it all happened again! The Indian food I'd experienced at home was sort of the same but in India..my god, I can't describe the first time I had a simple thali and a garlic naan. I stepped into the desi elevator and took a straight vertical ride to food heaven. And a literal auto ride to Old Delhi. I could bore the shit out of this sub for *hours* rattling on about soft galuti kebabs, gossamer-thin rumali roti, daulat ki chaat disappearing on my tongue, *feeling* diabetes setting in after two gulab jamoon & some burfi from Haldiram, not caring and having more....etc etc. Even a simple masala chai on the corner and talking gupshup with the chaiwallah unkill while I drink it brings me deep joy these days. Especially when he opens the tin he keeps under the counter, opens it and offers it to me, saying *""Biskoot?""* 

If any other *gorapakora's* are reading this and thinking about travelling to India to sample her delights, edible & otherwise, stop thinking & do it., you won't be sorry. If you're anything like me you'll be unequivocally, incurably, head-over-heels in love from the outset.

Edit; I'm still getting on planes 12 ish years later and going to India. Trip number ten in the autumn and nine months has been too long for this masala junkie. I'm straining at the leash to get back, see you soon *Mataji Bharat* ❤️ Chicken Tikka Masala is something I've heard a lot of non-indians like. So you can try that. Most of these are going to be similar to one another. No way this place has that much differentiation sitting around. I would go with Chicken Kadhai, it's a bit spicer than the others. Go for dosa and chutney/sambar during breakfast lol. Many non Indians like that..
Have tea/coffee along with that. Should be good. 

Tastes even better if it's raining outside! Come to India lol. You'll be mind blown. You should try biryani. Try indian sweets like gulag Jamie, rashgulla, jalebi Considering those are options that you have, then try them in the following order. Have them with naan, or tandoori roti or just plain rice. Order a side of green salad or make one at home.  

1. Chicken Korma
2. Chicken Muglai
3. Chicken Kadai
4. Butter Chicken
5. Chicken Tikka Masala
6. Chicken Saag
7. Chicken Jalfrezi
8. Chicken Curry
9. Chicken Vindalo
10. Chicken Kolapuri

This is sorted from least to most spicy, so that you get accustomed to the spices and be light on your stomach. 

A little lime goes a long way with these dishes.

And as u/thelielmao mentioned take care of your stomach, indian food will play a number on you, so pace yourself. Now you know the reason for 2 things.  

Western Colonization of Indian sub-continent.  
Western Youtube channels with their Indian-Food-tasting videos jacking up their view and subscriber count by multiple orders of magnitude. Glad you liked Indian food! There is a lot of variety in terms of cuisines and flavors as they change depending on the geography they come from. I hope you like the other types of Indian food too! Cheers! r/IndianFood Bloomington, MN. :)

Enjoy Indian food. It's a drug. Just remember there are mainly three types of famous delicious chicken cuisines:

  
1. **Butter chicken**, mouth watering! hell fucking lot of calories. But it's ok to have some times, i'd suggest to have it with butter nan. Not everyone can give you the real taste of it, check reviews before ordering.

2. **Afghani chicken**, named differently depending upon place to place.. it's works as starter with drinks, it's basically chicken with lot of cream on it, it's totally yum! again high in calories but not as high as BC.

3. **Tandoori Chicken**, baked in [tandoor](https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1CR8sQXXXXXaUXVXX760XFXXXt/229253608/HTB1CR8sQXXXXXaUXVXX760XFXXXt.png). Basically a spicy chicken marinated with indian masalas and roasted in Tandoors. It also works best with a beer, also less in calories(though also depends upon how much oil you put).  


These are main three chicken cuisines, you should try, rest of the things mentioned on menu are branched from these three only. Also, these three are named differently depending upon place to place. Tell you what, chicken tikka masala with either roomali rotis and a cheese garlic naan.

Butter chicken with plain naan and rice.

Chicken kadahi with naan.

These would be the most preferred combinations here. Then you can sample the rest. 

But be sure to have some water nearby. I have seen a few Europeans eat the same dishes with gusto in Goa and then be covered in perspiration. 

All the best! I LOVE THIS THREAD. You've have had lot of chicken dishes suggestion, I'll just say do try some Indian veg food too, it will get you an appreciation of veg food. first step done, now try cricket. [deleted] Try Jalfrezi next time.

On a side now, I hope your body is ready for tomorrow.

Don't 'lose' hope, exotic food will reshape your gut flora! 😂 [deleted]

Is good a sub You should choose depending on your spice bearing ability and how spicy that particular restaurant makes it. Butter chicken and Chicken korma would be kinda less spicy usually. A good korma would be delicious with Indian breads. Butter chicken is a classic. You could also try these curries with ""ghee rice"" or plain rice. You can ask for ghee rice they would probably make it for you.  Chicken Vindaloo is a goan preparation that is vinegary and goes well with plain rice more than breads. The rest are more suited to be had with breads. You can try Chicken Mughalai once !! r/IndianFood ",1559869690.0,1,138,0,242,"Hello /r/india,

I did not know where else to post this, so I hope this is appropriate. I've never in my life tried Indian food until today. Where I work, at the cafeteria, I decided I would try some Indian food. I honestly do not know what I even got.. to my regret.. I just pointed at something random and they served me a plate of this chicken with some type of thickish orange sauce (some type of curry?). It was honestly the most delicious thing I have ever eaten. Anyways, there's an Indian restaurant near me and I plan on ordering food there tomorrow. What are your recommendations of what I should try next? I'm thinking of a chicken entree. 

Here are my options for that:

Il Fungo Magico , Koregaon park, Pune. A very small restaurant with capacity of 12 ! Mostly caters to takeaway and home delivery .

930,Food,"From my experience I can talk about Italy.

Italian food focuses on fresh and high quality ingredients. A lot of dishes are created with few and relatively simple ingredients. Some things that are commonly eaten: Salad with only olive oil and balsamic vinegar or even bread with olive oil and salt. If you can do it with extra virgin olive oil, even better.

The food in general in Italy is amazing where ever you go, every region has its own version of the same dish. You have to get used to it though. At the beginning it might seem bland, but slowly you start tasting individual ingredients and it gets better then.

Indian restaurants here are not so good. So every time I feel like eating something spicy I eat a pizza/pasta with nduja (spicy pork) or just manage to cook something at home. US - I've been to Texas. The local food here is mostly Tex-Mex or Mexican and it isn't really far off from Indian spicy food. The other american food suggested by the people were mostly what you consider junk food here - pizza, burgers. Then there are english breakfast stuff - bacon, sausage, pancakes etc. In my two weeks there, I did not go to any Indian restaurants or homes of any Indians and I didn't miss the Indian food at all. In fact, it felt like I was in India but eating only restaurant food and non Indian cuisine.  
  
UK - Again 2 weeks in London. The breakfast options are the same as what you get here, but apart from that it's all fish and chips. Every other english food item (except dessert) I tried was plain bland. But London being a big city and all options available, I tried other cuisines and so I could manage. Also, pizza and burgers are readily available. I didn't go to any Indian places though. If I had to go to some small town where there aren't any Indian/Asian/Mexican restaurants, it would've been a struggle. Fish and chips would be available, but the fish is like boiled fish.  Also, london is expensive as fuck. Never going there again unless someone else pays my bills. Recently ate Singaporean stuff like laksa along with some Japanese stuff.its tolerable but yeah your spice intake will be reduced compared to Indian ones. Indonesian food is also very rich in spices. Even the fried rice is excellent. Try googling for Nasi Gudeg, Egg Balado, Sate with peanut sauce, Soto Ayam, Ikam Bakar Kecap Manis. Usually they also serve sambals, which are kind if like chutneys, but I like them more. I stead of pappadums, they have krupuk, of which krupuk udang( shrimp crackers) is my favourite. A good Kang Kung hitokaye or some capcay make good vegetables. Generally, Indonesian food is great, but the dessert scene is still lacking compared to India. 

Vietnamese Pho is something I truly enjoy. It has all the delicacy of Ramen, with less salt and more lemongrass. I liked it the moment I smelled it. 

American food was honestly a bit disappointing for me. Most of it was just uncooked salad or grilled steaks, hamburgers etc. or stuff like Mac n Cheese which I dislike. Food from Louisiana, especially Cajun and Creole dishes were very enjoyable though. I suspect there is a lot left I haven’t experienced. 

Caribbean food is delicious, but a bit limited in range. It can be just as spicy as Indian food, but it feels more wholesome. Jerk chicken is a dream. Food from South America, especially tacos and burritos and salsa were also to my taste, and they are very popular in the US. Cuban food is great. I wish our lentil curries tasted that good. 

British food was disappointing. Fish n Chips were ok at best. Generally I found they dishes from the rest of Europe was commonly found in the UK. Hungarian Goulash tasted good. The Brits are fairly good at baked desserts though, especially cakes and puddings. Sticky toffee pudding is good. 

I dislike almost all Chinese food I have tried save a few Sichuan dishes, mainly Mapo Tofu, Twice cooked pork, meatballs, cooked duck and some dim sum. Honestly the smell itself is sometimes a problem. Maybe, as you ask, if I tried going to China, I might change my opinion. I went to US an tried their food.It's not  with spices like ours. I can describe it as raw. Most westerners eat their food raw. The sweets are pretty good.  If you go to the restaurants you will be surprised as you pay lot of money for little food. At the end of the day there's nothing good as our own Indian style Living in US and been to Italy, France, Belgium and Netherlands.

US: You get everything here, by everything I dont mean Indian. I mean it taste wise. If you open up to eating all sorts of meats, then you have ample choice of good spicy cuisines. Mexican and Thai food can surprise you with the kind of spices they used, they are super hot (In US Hot is Teekha not garam). 

Italy: They know how to use spices, but not salt, if you add a little bit of salt to the dishes you are fine and I loved the food. Especially try their coastal food its Yum!

France: I only liked the bakery items, not that the food is bad, but ordering the right thing may take some efforts as they are not very friendly with English. However I must agree they use a very little to no exotic spices. Blant very blant food. 

Belgium: Again since they have a heavy influence of France, there food is similar but they have some good dishes which an Indian would love for the spices (again need to be open for many meat choices ).

Netherlands: Lovely culture and food and you can easily love their food being from any part of the planet. Burgers, sandwiches and salads mainly but super tasty.

&#x200B;

All I would say is  open up to all the choices, food is food ! And there are passionate people making it, keep your beliefs aside and try it! Canada -

932,Food,"Dad had diabetes. What helped him was exercise. One hour of exercise everyday. Do add that to the list. I have a slightly different question. My dad(and his sister and his dad) has diabetes(Type 2, detected after 45). My mom doesn't have diabetes but her mother(my grandma) had it. Therefore, my genes are full of diabetic dispositions. How do I minimize my chances of getting afflicted with diabetes? The amount of misinformation spread in this thread regarding diabetes amazes me. Please don't treat diabetes as a causal condition. It is indeed life altering. If you are in big city, get a diet chart from dietitian. I'm in the same boat basically. My mom and dad both had diabetes and I'm on a high risk as well. 

Well I'll tell you some stuff. This advice goes to anyone looking to live a healthy lifestyle and avoiding diabetes.

1) Do Intermittent fasting. Watch Dr Eric Berg's videos on YouTube on that topic. Basically what you wanna do is keep the insulin levels as low as possible to avoid being insulin resistant which leads to diabetes. Plus IF has numerous benefits.

2) Exercise is the best medicine. Doesn't matter what kind. No brainer.

3) Sugar is evil, I don't eat even a tiny bit. Sugar doesn't mean only sugary stuff it also means things high in carbs/glucose (rice). Search about glycemic index and why it's important. So eat right. Search ketogenic diet.

4) Keeping stress levels low, stress is related to all kinds of illnesses. 

5) Related to point number 1, don't eat too frequently in a day. Every time you eat you spike up your insulin levels and it's bad if your insulin spikes regularly causing insulin resistance so try eating twice a day. I eat twice a day once at 12pm and at 8pm followed by 16 hours of fasting. I've lost most of my belly fat, corrected my insulin resistance and I haven't felt so much better in a long time, all my symptoms of pre diabetes are gone. 


Intermittent fasting doesn't mean that you're 'fasting'. You can still eat any amount of food you want but only in a given time window. 

Research about these things and good luck! r/desiketo My father was diagnosed with diabetes at age 46 and exercise was the miracle cure for him. His diabetes was still in early stages when I made him join a gym and quit all sugary/junk food. In 6 months his sugar levels went from 600 to 90 and that level's been consistent even after 2 years. I guess what helped him the most was that we started early and didn't let it get worse. 

Even tho his sugar levels are not high anymore, we still don't allow him sugar. For tea he only drinks green tea or black tea, we don't add too much ghee or butter to his diet because of high carbs, no more junk food and regular exercise. Altho you need to find what works the best for your father because everyone's different. Check out intermittent fasting. I've read it can reverse even type 2 diabetes.

Google about it and read more on its sub - r/intermittentfasting My father had diabetes since his early 40s and was able to keep it under control till his legs began to trouble him in his late 70s. He walked for 45mins every day whether it rained or it was freezing. Also he followed a strict diet of no sugar, no potatoes and very small amount of rice. Exercise and diet control is only help. [deleted] Stop eating carbs and it should all be fine My mom and dad both have diabetes and after the changes they made they feel younger, fitter, and healthier than ever. 

1. Exercise. Daily exercise is extremely important. Minimum 1hr everyday. Brisk walk is good. 

2. Diet. I can't comment about non-veg food because we are vegetarians but they made 2 massive changes. Learn that everything white is poison. Cut out white rice, wheat, sugar and salt. They replaced it with Millets. So they now make Jowar/Bajra Rotis or instead of wheat rotis, and use Millet rice instead of white rice. [The Millet Table](https://www.millettable.com) has a lot of recipes to teach you how to use millets. 

3. Don't abandon sweets or you'll have cravings you'll give in to it and gorge on it. The best diet is the one you can maintain. So make sweets ocassionally but slowly reduce sugar and substitute with Palm Sugar, jaggery, etc. 

Ear more vegetables. So make 2 sabjis everyday instead of one. Fill up using vegetables instead of carbs Loosing weight is must. Find the ideal BMI for his age group and stay close to it. Belly fat is most dangerous. Being diabetic means excess pressure on kidneys and liver which can also affect the heart. Processed foods are a no go. Find a meal plan and stick to it. No cheat days. Prepare your meals early if you know there are going to be plans. Strict regiment diet and exercise is the key, nothing else. I wouldn't recommend a very low carb diet as our body needs energy to function. Just find healthier alternatives. Any product with low ' glycemic index ' will work(GI around 55). [Have a look](http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/what-can-i-eat/understanding-carbohydrates/glycemic-index-and-diabetes.html).

Some examples-Jwar,Bajra,Oatmeal. Type 2 Diabetic here. Went from 126 mg/mL to 93 mg/mL sugar levels in 3 months.

In veggies choose vegetables that your father can eat without getting gassy. 

Soya products totally out.

Milk totally out. 

Meat doesn't need to be and shouldn't be lean. Use fatty cuts. 

Remove beans completely if it makes your father gassy. 

Look more for portion control and carb quality than choosing the carb content.

Ten minute walk after each meal. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. 

2 eggs a day. The choline in egg yolks will help control blood sugar.

Supplement vitamin D3. Do LowCarb.

If he's T2D consider Keto. Follow youtube channels like eric berg and beat diabetes. Overtime if you do not make dietary changes the baseline sugar level increases making it difficult to control blood sugar. At his age their needs to be a strict monitoring of carbohydrate consumption otherwise complications can arise Might wanna try intermittent fasting or low carb diets. Do your research before Please please please spend time researching what I'm saying below. 

This stuff really works.

Get the book called The Diabetes Code by Dr. Jason Fung.

Immediately cut out soy products, LEAN meat.

Remove all vegetable/seed oils - sunflower oil, canola oil, etc. (all omega-6 rich, which is bad).

Only oil that's suitable for India, mostly - unrefined coconut oil (omega-3 rich).

Look up Jason Fung's talks on intermittent fasting on YT.

Look up Eric Berg on Youtube.

Look up Satchin Panda's interviews/lectures on YouTube, and learn about Time Restricted Eating.

Finally, read a few things from dietdoctor dot com's news/blog section.


Exercise WILL NOT CURE AILMENTS. It's good to generally exercise but it isn't a cure to anything, not even weight loss.

Check out Jackfruit 365 products on Amazon or their videos on YouTube.

As much as the world of medicine would like you to believe it's a persistent, chronic, worsening disease, IT ISN'T! I am not an expert here, but oatmeal is also good for diabetes. Just don’t go for masala or any spiced oats. 
Just plain and simple oat is good. You DM me.

yaad se. Basically anything that is keto friendly will keep his diabetes under control. My mom could go off her diabetes meds following keto. But she had to start taking them after she stopped following it. Do mind this is for type 2 diabetes. It's lethal for someone with type 1 diabetes. About food, best is javaari ki roti. Sabji must not be too spicy and must have good water content. Less sugar. My father too has diabetes but is in control. And regular exercise is a must Cut down sugar and alcohol. Also track calories (eg. with myfitnesspal) and avoid overeating. For your dad 2000 calories per day should be plenty. ",1559975547.0,1,91,0,54,"My dad(62)has diabetes for almost 16 years now.

937,Food,"There's two ways to address your question/rant/whatever: a point-by-point refutation, and a big picture refutation. Let me try a bit of both.

Big picture: you need to understand our history to fully understand the scale of crises we've already dealt with. Separatist violence - Kashmir, Punjab, North East, Naxalism, Maoism, severe (real) food shortage - we used to depend on imported foodgrains before the green revolution made us self-sufficient, immense ignorance and illiteracy - we had 15% literacy in 1940s, and a paper-thin govt. Even as late as 2000s, we had endemic power shortage leading to long cuts even in summers. These problems were solved and now the country is self-sufficient in power generation, and most power sector issues are DISCOM-specific (economically).

Now we're a 3T economy, with 75% literacy rate, 600 billion dollars available for the central and state govts. to spend in tax revenue, a growing economy - exact rate of which is disputed but 5-6% is a number we can agree on.

Half the issues you raised are trivial/moot.

> The rate at which water is wasted

To an extent fixable, as our local bodies get their shit together. When on the brink of crisis, people find ways to solve problems. The tanker mafia crisis in metros is actually a boon because it provides economic incentives for conservation - people are installing unit-level IoT water meters in apartment buildings, recycling for flushing etc. and so on.

> The food might run out due to the surge in population

Balderdash. Our food production issues were solved during Green Revolution. No country with a GDP/capita of $2000 and growing is starving, and is rich enough to import foodgrains if a massive catastrophe impacts production temporarily for a couple of years. For every suicide you see in papers, there are 10 farmers making a living, not a luxurious living - sure, but can feed themselves and their families.

The surge in population bit is BS. Our population growth is slowing down, TFR is down to 2.3 which is very close to the replacement rate. If you can feed 1.3B today, you can handle 1.33B the next year and so on. At 1.6B or so our population will stabilize, and we'll finally be at a stage where the number of people is not outstripping the amount of roads/railways we build.

Worldwide, there's a glut of agricultural produce.

> Air pollution due to unchecked emissions

Every country goes through a phase of unchecked industrial growth, which is contained as those issues hit crisis levels. If you go back a hundred years you'll read similar stories about Thames or Sienne.

> Religious, racial and political issues

We had bigger religious/political/racial issues 50 years back, and law enforcement was poorer, and people were less educated. A handful of cases in backward districts are blown up by the 24x7 media.

The average Hindu might not be a fan of the average Muslim, but he has no problems buying goods or services from him. It leads to gentrification, but not religious violence.

> Tremendously increasing pressure on metro cities

Yes, our economic growth is very unequally distributed. You can leave your 20LPA job in Bangalore and get 5 offers in a week, but in a tier-3 town you'd be hard pressed to find a 3LPA job. To an extent cities like Pune and Hyderabad are taking off, but it's still too less.

> Government and government employees being their worst at their jobs.

Unkill-ish hand-waving. There are plenty of problems with govt, but they are also facing ever-increasing scrutiny, with public pressure to create complaint handling mechanisms, and expectations of time-bound handling of complaints. The situation is far better with central govt. employees, and state govts. could do a lot better.

-------------

TL;DR is that yes, we'll face hetherto unforeseen livability challenges over the next 15 years. In this time frame, we'll also start transitioning to a clean energy economy, planned urban spaces, stronger pollution enforcement and so on. All problems are solvable as you become richer, and there's no indication that we won't continue on the path of economic growth - we might slip to 5% from 9%, but the growth engine will keep on chugging along.

Edit: thank you, kind anon, for the gold :)

Edit 2: interesting quote I found from Norman Borlaug's wiki:

_Biologist Paul R. Ehrlich wrote in his 1968 bestseller The Population Bomb, ""The battle to feed all of humanity is over ... In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now."" Ehrlich said, ""I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks India will be self-sufficient in food by 1971,"" and ""India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980.""_ it already sucks. takes me 45 mins to cover mere 5 kms. huge waste of time and fuel. Liveable if you got ₹₹₹. I would like to remind people that India has gone through pretty shitty times during the last couple of centuries. Just go through the major catastrophes that befell us. Famines, the world wars, the partition massacres, crushing poverty, widespread riots, wars with neighbors, violent secession movements, etc.

It's true, this time too it's going to be difficult. These threats that you outline might unravel our society.

But then again, they might not. I have faith in the fundamental goodness of the country and its people. These threats might well cause us to rise above our narrow differences and bond together as fellow humans. I saw a hint of this during the last floods in Kerala, when people came together to help each other. I am sure that a common enemy will force us to rediscover our shared humanity once again. Paili fursat me nikalna h I have strong opinions on climate change, so please bear with me.

I think climate change is going to disrupt everything in the next decade. Every week, there is some news about it. We read it, feel helpless and move on with our lives. Then turn around and blame it on the politicians and others. Sometimes we also act and make small changes in our lifestyle; stop using plastic bags, save water, etc.

However, nobody really knows what's in store for us. We get warnings every other week. This is the hottest month, the civilization is ending in 2050, the insects all dying, the corals being bleached, food chain is collapsing, etc. At some point, you just stop paying attention. What can we do, after all. These problems are so big and intractable, right?

Wrong. We can do something; [plant trees](https://www.livescience.com/65880-planting-trees-fights-climate-change.html). Trees are the only way we can save our planet. We all fondly remember our childhood and trees played a central role in it. I used to climb up the trees in my backyard and pluck the fruits. I haven't done that in decades. Where has our love for trees gone?

We need to rediscover our love for trees. Only then can we save the planet. I just need some way to get out of here. I'll become a taxi driver if that's what it takes. Yes, it may not seem like it but things are actually getting better. 

On the water front, our home in Bangalore had a borewell (just like everyone else), but with the adoption of rainwater harvesting and the arrival of Kaveri water, we use the borewell a lot less than before. We've noticed that the water table level has risen. As more people adopt these measures, the water shortage will improve.

On the traffic front, more public transport (like Metro) is being adopted in more cities. (Unbelievably, Lucknow has a metro now!) Overall, this will take years (maybe decades) to build out but it will definitely resolve some of the traffic issues.

Also, with good metro, high-speed rail etc. in combination with village electrification and running water, the pressure to move to cities like Bangalore will reduce. And then as seccond and third tier cities like Mysore or Mandya being to acquire modern amenities, some businesses will relocate there further reducing the pressure on the big cities.

Also, there was a research paper studying the impact of global warming on the Indian monsoon which found that it is going to result in the subcontinent getting 10% more rain. (If you're surprised by this, don't be. Warmer air can hold more moisture in it and the south west monsoon gets its moisture from the Indian Ocean, which is not going to run out of water.) This is a huge amount of extra water which will actually be good for our country. Of course, the possibility of floods and cyclones increases with global warming, but as last year's cyclone Foni showed, these are manageable problems if competent people are in charge.

Now, all this will take decades to have an impact on your immediate situation, but in the long run, we are on the right path. The most immediate problem is the water, while others will not make India uninhabitable in the short term. The government needs to sort out the water crisis. Some of the responses above highlighted most of the key issues. I work as a researcher and practitioner in the area of urbanisation, specifically in the areas of mobility, water and sanitation and governance. My reply therefore might not add any value or could be  terribly narrow and blinkered, so do bear with me. 

Indian cities, like those in other parts of the developing world, are exploding in terms of their population growth. Urbanisation at this rate is unprecedented in human history, so even though we might know potential solutions, the scale that we need to cover is mindboggling.

Unfortunately, our governments do not have the financial or human resources to structure and order this process. Therefore, while we have good policies and legislations for the most part, governments are not in a position to enforce them. Take the case of water supply in Bangalore. Pumping water from a distance of 100 kms and an elevation of 300 metres, BWSSB manages a world class system in bringing water to the doorsteps of Bangalore, spending tens of thousands of crores.  However, once it reaches the city, the horrible distribution network within the city means that lakhs of households are not connected to this network. The old pipelines also cause leakage and leads to 45% of this water to be considered as 'wasted'. Fixing the whole network would costs hundreds of thousands of crores, if we had the capacity to do it. So we don't. For politicians, they've managed to bring water for residents, so they continue to get elected. For bureaucrats, they've acheieved the same, so they continue to work in the same manner, pushing for low-hanging fruits rather than engage in structural reform. 

We citizens also contribute significantly to it, ignoring and avoiding any roadblocks that reduces our comfort. We flout building norms, traffic rules and labor laws because we know the state doesn't have the capacity to enforce the law. So whoever can afford to, digs borewells to ensure that they have a coping mechanism. However, even after knowing of water scarcity, we don't change our lifestyles to adapt to these new conditions. We still want to wash our cars daily or leave the shower running because it suits us. We don't want to install rainwater harvesting systems because we don't want to spend money. 

Right now, society as a whole is continuing on its business as usual path. The problem is that resources are running out and climate change will exacerbate all of our existing problems. Water is going to be undoubtedly the largest. Some studies have pointed out that by 2025, Bangalore would be unlivable due to the lack of water. The situation is pretty much the same in most other parts of the country as a casual scan of the news for the past 3-4 months should confirm. 

Can this be reversed? Possibly. But we don't seem to want to do it. As time goes on, it becomes more and more harder and expensive to get there as well. Unfortunately, given the humungous inequality in our society, it means that the privileged will be able to access technology and government support to continue in the same fashion. The poor will suffer. We as a country are just managing to improve upon our modest baseline in making the lives of the citizen better, climate change will definitely push it back down. Life expectancy and incomes will reduce for the poor, while expenses for healthcare will drastically increase. 

When people's lives are not getting any better, social divisions tend to widen. Violence as a whole might increase, especially in areas with little policing along the lines of gender, religion, region, caste and class. However, this is something that the State and the political class like to manage/control, so rather than an anarchic society, we may see an apathetic State which condones violence. 

The answer to issues like air pollution and water scarcity has been around for ages, we've only done what we could do to postpone dealing with the question. For air pollution, it's getting people off their vehicles and on to public transport. People reply (and legitimately so) that there is no public transport system. Governments say that they don't have the money to buy buses, although they spend an order of magnitude more on building flyovers and expressways (which only incentivise people to use their vehicles more). It becomes just another vicious cycle. 

Unless all of us come back and take a serious look at the social contract that we have and our roles within it, I think that we're all screwed. Water scarcity will be unbearable, heat and cold waves will kill off an increasing number and violence will possibly increase drastically. Food production might remain stable, but given the changes in rainfall patterns and our agricultural style, I might be being optimistic. The State will continue to function as it currently does, trying to make the best of a terrible hand. 
You and I and everyone else here will possibly continue to live a similar life. We're the elites. The above points are very much valid day by day the quality of life is degrading. Only the rich are immune to this as they dont spend much time on the ground and usually are away. You are assuming that with a growing GDP India does not deal with its water, poverty, and pollution problems. That isn't going to happen. We saw that as China grew it dealt with its problems to the point that it has better infrastructure now than most Western countries. It is a world leader in solar and electric vehicles and has taken drastic actions to cut smog levels in places like Beijing. 

Just look at what India has done in the last 10 years, brought over 250 million out of poverty. Built world class metro systems in Delhi and is in the process of doing so in Mumbai and other cities. Built world class airports in the major cities and good airports in second and third tier cities. 

India is greatly investing in railway infrastructure including building its first bullet train. It's introduced domestically produced semi high speed trains and renovated many stations. 

Per capita income is doubling roughly ever 10 years. The middle class is going to keep exploding. As people enter the middle class they will have higher aspirations for everything from education to sanitation to transportation. And once there is a solid middle class politicians will have no choice but to be responsive. 

So your ""sky is falling"" attitude is missing the point. As another poster mentioned, within 15 years India should reach 20k USD per capita GDP (PPP). This is around the level of EU member states like Bulgaria or Romania or other middle income countries such as Malaysia, Colombia, Mexico or Argentina. These are all livable places but not nearly as large as India. When India reaches that level it is going to be an enormous accomplishment and it will have incredible economic and geopolitical power as a result. Aren't point 1-5 by outcome of point 6. Is India actually livable *today*? This is ridiculous fear-mongering. Bharat has a very bright future, we just need to stay at it. We’ve accomplished so much in the last 15 years it’s insane to think otherwise. Most Northern states are 0.700+ in HDI minus Kashmir. South India is doing fairly ok. Central and NE India lag behind a lot but will catch up. 

We have the best airport and metro system in New Delhi. We’re building and investing in solid public transport and upgrading our railways. 

Land rights and labor reforms are expected any minute which will unlock a lot of capital to the middle class and make doing business much easier. Climate change? Buddy, Chennai is facing a water crisis due to 1) terrible management of their water resources 2) pollution and 3) very little rainfall. 

Our economic growth is good and we will have per capita income of 25,000 USD by 2050. Our national HDI is probably gonna be around 0.800-0.850. Not entirely 1st world tier but GOOD enough that every Bharatiye citizen has a  decent life. It depends on 2 factors:

1) No matter which [countries release carbon-dioxide](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-the-worlds-carbon-emissions-in-one-chart/), India will suffer because of our location in the tropical latitudes. More than 80% of world's electricity still comes from burning coal. There is a lot of coal left in China, USA and India.How will food crop production be affected by warming. While increasing carbon-dioxide might sound good for plants, how will our food crops fare under increasing heat trapped because of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and water-vapor? 

2) [Indians born after 1961](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution#Start_in_India) owe their existence to food grown by feeding synthetic fertilizers to crops. India's population in 1961 was 438 million. 900 million Indians were not supposed to be born. So, in a way, we have been living on borrowed time. Fertilizers require methane which is a by-product of crude-oil extraction. Food is tightly dependent on oil. There is a lot of oil left in the middle-east but we know how that story is going to go.

\--------------------

The timeline of collapse is hard to predict. Water problems are plaguing us now. But we are not experiencing collapse yet because we can still burn fossil energy to get water. We can use diesel power to drill down 1000 feet and pump up ground water using electrical energy (produced mostly by burning coal). In the next decade, there will be more of the same. We will drill down to 2000 feet to fetch water. For this to continue, we need to keep importing more and more oil competing with USA and China.

I predict that we will witness a great die-off (in stages) before 2050. After that, our population (with natural farming being top occupation) will be around 100 million. Cities will be deserted as food transportation and distribution (supported right now by fossil-energy) will cease. People will have to live in villages near to where food is produced. Basic mathematics says.....yes. 

Consider that India's per capita PPP income is $8000 and growing at 6% per year. In 15 years, it will be $20,000 per capita PPP, which is about the same as Mexico, Argentina, etc.  Those are definitely liveable countries. 

Population wise, India is already at 2.1 TFR, which is the replacement rate. From now on population will grow, but at a decreasing rate, peaking around 2050 and declining thereafter. 

Most of India's air pollution comes from old inefficient vehicles, which people cannot afford to replace. This will be addressed by the increasing per capita income. People will be able to afford less polluting vehicles. Removal of diesel subsidy will also help.

India is making great strides in solar power to add to this.

Water is a problem, but it can be solved by better transport facilities and desalination if needed. 

The rest of what you mentioned - Mandir, etc is just insignificant noise. Thats like saying USA is unlivable because of school shootings. Except 4 and 6, the others can be fixed. Forest man

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkZDSqyE1do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkZDSqyE1do) Yeah, we are fucked in the long run. That's for sure if we don't do something about this. We as human beings are always capable of extra ordinary feats. We can overcome this. no democracy, no decency, no jobs, no growth, no accountability, no justice, no law and order, no clean air or water, no food safety, no harmony, no exports, no unity,no human rights, no free press...etc etc  if all these are happening then a country descends into chaos really fast. 

How far is india already down this path ..you make your own call 2 decades ago, it was very popular opinion that way India is making progress and how our five year plans are being implemented,  India will be a developed country by year 2020. 

Though we have somewhat better facilities , health care and access to some of the luxuries like car, phone and air travel, muncipal water  we are still very far behind in self sustainability.


 Reasons: the way political parties ruled India in 80s, 90s is via religion and communal gap. We all assumed the education and rise in literacy will erase that gap.
Continuing,  even today education hasn't brought much progress in the attitude of brainwashed general public.

Until if majority of population vote for basic ammenities and  matured leadership as first priority, things will remain the same.

Politicians did great job in brainwashing the most educated of the country as well.  Recently I stumbled up on a post by a person with designation of corporate director stating "" Patel statue is good for regular public as lot of contractors and raw material suppliers benefits from the project iteranary !""  Little did he agree that there are many pending irrigation and road -rail, flyovers and they provide same source of income to builders and self sustaining. 

There is no solution to this problem and emmigrating to other countries is the closest possible solution. You're on the mark with regards to deteriorating conditions. The single biggest hurdle is population which is too large to manage reasonably. ",1563118656.0,1,85,0,87,"Consider these points before answering - 

1. The rate at which water is wasted in India (due to breakage in pipes, overflowing government tankers, etc) is tremendous when considered holistically
2. The food might run out due to the surge in population and limited lands and farmers not getting paid enough to sustain their livelihoods
3. Air pollution due to unchecked emissions from factories and vehicles
4. Religious, racial and political issues
5. Tremendously increasing pressure on metro cities like Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai
6. Government and government employees being their worst at their jobs. Add to that the ever-present corruption in almost anything

Consider all of these points and others that highly hurdle your life and living standards. Now consider how all of these things affect the poor who can't even get basic education and also the reservation system in government jobs. Like seriously, half of the country is facing water crisis and it is going to be worse in the coming years. Water is a basic resource and it might lead to people doing crazy shit for just water, which many of us waste. Pollution is increasing - air, water, noise, land. Waste management sucks, plastics clogs almost every sewer line in the country. Meanwhile, the government is busy dealing with issues like ""Mandir yahi banega"", Yogi Adityanath is burning tonnes of mango woods to kill global warming (dude doesn't know that burning produces carbon which is the main greenhouse gas). 

&#x200B;

These are the main things that the government should be focussing on because these things only dictate our living standards. And if we keep on neglecting these things, then we are fucked in the long run.

PS.  Its a rule.  They have to put water dispensers.  But fuckers won't put them. So if you ask them and they deny you can always threaten them about the rule. okay pop corn is over priced but what about water ? OMG ! Two ice creams and one medium pepsi = ₹420!!! If it wasnt 420 I would have backed off! You can bring your own food and water to cinema halls (atleast in my state , but would apply pan india)

https://www.livelaw.in/movie-goers-can-carry-food-water-inside-multiplexes-cinema-theatres-jammu-kashmir-hc-read-judgment/ The amount of ads I saw during watching John wick 3, I don't think they have any right to charge that much. Abey yar their food sales will increase tenfold if they slash the prices by half. That's when you rob Bandhan bank. 1. I've almost reduced going to watch movies in multiplex to zero. My big TV and online streaming gives me more value for money



2. When I do go, I eat something before hand and just carry a bottle of water. I don't understand why we should buy them? Only If all of us stop buying any thing at Cinemas ...... Can we also talk about airport food? 

I recently landed in bangalore airport and had a 5-hour layover before I took flight to my hometown.

I went for a dosa outside the airport - It was ₹200+ for a plain dosa, which was terrible. 
A bland, very poorly made curd rice inside the airport was at ₹168+taxes. WTF dude?

I understand that real estate is more expensive at airports, but how can you hike up the prices 300%? Nowhere else in the world is there such a difference. Airport food is usually 10-20% more expensive but not 2x-3x times like in India. I don't understand, why do people buy from them? An average movie is about 2 hours. You couldn't eat anything before coming to the movie? Why buy such overpriced snack? Just buy a packet of biscuit and eat it before entering the hall. In the US, I can get a movie ticket for 14$ and large tub of popcorn with free refill (put together probably five times larger than the largest you can get in PVR) and a coke medium size for less than 12. That is, a single movie ticket price is more expensive than the stuff you buy for a party of two. Somehow they managed to get the equation reversed in India the stuff costs more than the movie ticket itself. WtF? Who in their right mind orders overpriced food items outside the movie theater? I recently went to Insignia Inox, which has like a base ticket price of 800, but it was a morning show so a lot cheaper. And you go in, and you have like a button to calla butler, and you have Menus next to you. They sell Dahi Puri for 300 While we are on the topic. Can we pls notice that even after literally paying money you STILL GET FUCKINNNG ANNOYING ADS! 
YouTube is better at least it’s totally free. 
I miss the days where they only show you movie trailers. Eat at home before you go to watch a movie. Middle class master race :| Maharashtra mein kya scene hai btw?Allowed to bring your own food kya I was discussing this with a family member and I said that I would gladly pay 100 Rs extra for a ticket for the freedom to bring my own food. That makes much more sense than charging sky-high prices for food. *taalis laat Last time i went to pvr, they charged me nearly 900 rs for a large popcorn and 2 medium Pepsi. Whereas movie ticket price was just 220 rs. PVR and INOX are actually in popcorn business. ^^/s recently went to one of the better pvrs. they had flavored popcorns that they gave out in ziplock bags. we took a medium for 220 bucks chocolate flavor. they were so good and so fulfilling. it was pretty great for 220 bucks. two of us shared that pack and we struggled to finish it off.  

next time went to a not so great pvr. paid 220 for similar popcorn. and it was garbage stale stuff. 

this is what annoys me. Why suddenly people are posting memes in this sub? I feel that they rob us in broad daylight. If questioned that start to fight. Sanki people I must say. PVR is solely the culprit for exorbitant food prices in cinemas. Before PVR expanded nationally, local cinema chains used to offer Popcorn Pepsi combo for 150 and samosa for 40. After looking at PVR's fat margins, other cinema chains got greedy and followed suit. Lol in Cinepolis the medium size popcorn and the large size popcorn price difference is only 10 rupees , so whenever you order medium ,the guy tells you that large costs only 10 rupees more , so you buy the large one anyways also they sell fucking Vada pav for 100 rupees that is ridiculous eventhough they use more pósh looking pav and ingredients. I hate this. Had posted this on Facebook some time back and a 'genius' in my list commented that ""Hey, the cost is high because they're giving you a chance to eat before a large screen."" I was like - that doesn't make any sense.

The concept is of a rental property - you rent a place and you can most definitely have your own food there. For example, hotel room, airplane flight. (The same doesn't hold true for a restaurant because food's the main business of the restaurant. But cinemas? It's bullshit.)

So I told him that cineplexes should be allowed to do one of two things:

1. Don't allow outside food but then charge reasonably
2. Allow outside food and charge whatever they want (like a hotel's restaurant would do).

I also said that I lean towards option 2 because it promotes 'freedom of choice'. It was heartening to see some cities' theatres allow outside food. And here in Australia where I have recently moved, ALL theatres allow outside food, as it should be. Rs.10 coffee for Rs.150. #savagepvr And then they demand Rs. 60 for a 500 ml water bottle which is filled with nothing but tap water. Pespi? Really? Instagram memes on reddit? Lol. Didn't know it was that much cheaper 😂😂 That's the reason I'm bankrupt right now Thankfully, most PVRs have started keeping a water cooler and glasses so that if you're just a little thirsty, you don't have to fork out 80 bucks for a whole bottle. Since they don't allow you to bring your own water in. Brighter side I guess. Popcorn is more expenses than the ticket itself. Dude I feel this meme to my core. Bought 2 popcorns and 2 pepsis, Rs. 1200+

I mean... Wtf. Taalis lakh when pespi chaalis lakh when Pepsi PVR: Popcorn Vada raidshow Taalis Laat I need more indian memes on reddit Pespi Dank. Food in cinema is only for crazy rich people. you have made me watch again this part of the movie Cold drinks at 300 wtf not sure if you guys know this but theatres earn very little from ticket sales and most of their earnings come for sales of these food items. For those complaining about the price, I understand all the frustration but remember that a theater's business model revolves completely on the food and beverage sector. Money from the tickets goes straight to the distributor or the production company. Maybe i am mistaken with how it works in India but as per my understanding, Theater's run only due to the sales of F&B on a daily basis and advertisements before and during intermission of the films Need a Indian meme sub why is this so true! These multiplex chains have three main source of revenue:
1. Ticketing
2. Advertisement
3. F&B (Food & Beverages)

F&B segment has highest margin somewhere between 80-85%.

941,Food,"It is just a colloquial way of saying to stay hydrated. Let's not make everything an issue. 

&#x200B;

Dehydration is a common thing during summers. Hence they say foods to cool down. 

Additionally, we also observe eating spicy or acidic foods and toxic foods, exposure to the sun for long times lead to boils, or heat rashes. 

&#x200B;

Most of the foods recommended to cool down are meant to cool down or are less acidic (like yogurt/ lassi and all)in nature to balance diet. Ayurveda is based on superficial observations and correlations. In fact, there is no need to single out Ayurveda. All pre-scientific ethno-medicines are arbitrary. Traditional Chinese Medicine, Unani (Greek) are based on very basic (often wrong) observations. And our language has not been purged off some badly chosen terms either. For example, the term 'boil'. Why is a skin boil called boil? These common sense terms hinder our understanding.

And these systems did not know about the perception tricks played by brain. Mint 'feels' cold on the tongue because the molecules unlock receptors that are supposed to detect low temperature. Spicy food 'feels' hot and causes sweating because brain is fooled by capsaicin unlocking high-temperature receptors.

Some observations, however, still hold true even when their models were wrong.

For example, a shaman using some leaf paste along with elaborate rituals and dancing to cure malarial fever will be successful. His model might be wrong but he will succeed nonetheless. Only problem is the shaman cannot know which parts of his cure are worthless and which is the active part actually doing the treatment.

Or system which attributes disease like tuberculosis to a spirit and recommends quarantine will be right despite having a wrong model. (spirit rather than micro-organisms)

Ayurveda is the same. It's based on a bad foundation. Naturally, (pun unintended), it will have wrong diagnoses and wrong treatments. And it doesn't help that it's not revised thanks to our taboo of updating ancient wisdom. Food-induced thermogenesis. Different foods have different calorific values. Some foods take more calories to digest and others don’t so the sum total or calories or heat they add to you is positive or negative. None of this can change the fact that you seem to be a jackass. Just like other bullshits such as positive energy and negative energy.. Try beef and see the difference in your body temperature. IMO it's not about body heat but about how the foods make you feel, mostly in the gastrointestinal tract. Eating a lot spicy food has the opposite effect of eating a lot of curd rice for example and it's not far fetched to associate those feelings with heat and cold respectively. Other foods can be categorised in the same way. It’s Ayurveda. 

It’s bullshit anyway. If it's annoying you then why listen? Just do whatever you like Honest opinion, if I eat chicken or certain foods, I do get constipated(even though I ensure I have enough fiber) and limbs are heated.


I have been informed it is that the nature of my body is heat and rather consume it in low amounts. This is personal experience.


For ex : I require cooler AC when compared to other family members. I tolerate winters better but summers are hell.


Hope I get to see a good discussion. Good question though. It's easy to understand, certain food take more energy(heat) to digest than others and it matters during scorching summer Really dude?
You thinking food doesn't affect body temperature? 

Why do you drink lemonade during summer? 

Why don't you ever try eating mangoes(without soaked in water or fridge)? everyone knows it's tummo that controls this force, not food.  2,4-Dinitrophenol  is a drug that is banned in US and UK, is used by many body builders to rapidly burn off body fat. The drug works by forcing the cells to use up the ATP rapidly, forcing the body to tap into existing body fat. It was used by Russian soldiers in WW2 to stay warm in severe Siberian winter.

This drug comes with a risk of acute toxicity and is known to be lethal. One of the ways it kills is by increasing the core temperature , resulting in organ shutdown. Essentially, a chemically induced lethal heat stoke.

&#x200B;

Also,  d-*amphetamine* , a widely known recreational drug is known to decrease heat dissipation and slow the rise of core temperature. It was widely abused by runners and endurance athletes till reports of death due to extreme muscle fatigue and heart failure started to show up. Essentially ,it turned the body into a heat sink that would absorb more heat than dissipate. You’re taking it too literally.  The body heat that your mom mentions is not temperature. Bhai thoda chill maar Yeah chief, you are unfortunately after falling down a long fad diet hole.

Do yourself a favour and forget about it. It's the hot and cold diet today tomorrow it'll be liquidised steak enemas. The sooner you learn to disregard these people rather than try and change their opinion the happier you will be in life.

No you'd just get on and not talk about it ever. Neither of you could be 100% right about it and you would never convince the other person, so what is the point?

946,Food,"Street food, is prepared on the street. 

Those pizzas, are prepared in a kitchen inside. Where they wash their hands and keep the surroundings clean. They have regular checks for any health code violations etc. 

That stuff isn't taken that seriously in India, especially with street food. No one cares how it's made. You're mentioning about street food and stating items like Pizza, KFC. An acquaintance of mine, a 3rd/4th  gen Malaysian Indian, told me his story. He visits India on business every 6 months or so. Once he ate street food. He went back and developed serious stomach issues much later. His doctor advised him that some viruses/bacteria (whatever) can remain dormant in stomach and show up six months later.

He eats Indian foods at home in Malaysia.  And strictly avoids street food here.

So, yes, some people do get sick from Indian street food. There is a big difference in hygiene between you random street gol gappe seller who dips his dirty hand into the water and a pizzaiolo handling the dough in the restaurant. 

I guess it is just due to them seeing different food from an alien culture. When I brought my grandma pizza for the first time, she was like dafuq is this shit, I can make like 20 parathas for the same price. 

Have you heard about Delhi Belly btw? 

I like both Indian street food and western food (except anything with potatoes), especially Italian food.  

And honestly Indian tasted great but can often look unappealing. Stop giving a fuck about them. Why does it matter? You say foreigners and then refer to them as having rank 5. Bolna kya chahte ho?

For your solace, they don't wash their ass after shitting. Just wipe with paper towel and boo! Ewww... The issue isn’t street food, it’s the water used in the preparation of those street food. I think there was a post on r/India about a pani Puri vendor filling water from the toilet...

Do you still blame them? Because it will give you rocket shits strong enough to propel you right to the moon.  Not because it’s spicy, because contrary to what you folks seem to believe we can handle our spicy food just fine, but because it’s covered with wind-blown dirt, dried dog piss and shit and all sorts of intelligent life forms breeding in those giant piles of garbage.

And their Pizza smells like shit to me. And they have more cancer patients compare to Indians (5th place in the whole world)

Seriously, this is brainwashing of the highest level. Nothing more. Any Jains here who support this? This is Child abuse. I have been waiting for someone to pick this topic up. Sadly, Jainism doesn't attract much criticism for some unfathomable reasons. There's a rampant wave of teenagers becoming monks, at least in Mumbai where I live. Its crazy and horrifying. 

&#x200B;

These white clad monks brainwash their followers by paraphrasing their scriptures in fluent English. Their system is flawed just like every other religion. In my opinion, they're not great just because they renounce all materialistic things in life. There's no substance to their reasoning. They don't accept food from anyone who's not Jain. That's discrimination there itself. Also, everybody needs food to survive. They should earn their bread by sweating instead of cashing in on their monkhood, which contradicts their claims of non-materalistic life in the first place. Its easy to pretend to be on spiritual journey when your monkhood ensures food and shelter. 

&#x200B;

Coming back to the crazy trend, Jain communities treat these monks as gods. No surprise their kids aspire to become one. They hold grand ceremonies to give farewell to the kids who wanna be monks. That is an outright mental abuse of teenagers. FFS someone should raise voice against it.  Jains have little to no history of reform or revolution in their practices at massive scale through means of criticism, protest or upheaval. Recipe for most regressive practices in the system. It feels so disheartening watching all these talented kids renounce everything & that too for what? Inner peace? Soul searching?

What a difference those kids could have made to the world… I have a contrarian take on this. This may well be the route to a happier life than the life led by the average person.

The other point is that the kids are too young to decide. But aren't they also too young to decide they want to live the default life chosen by our society? We are all also equally brainwashed since young to be materialistic and value certain things over others. Rich people things I might be downvoted for this but this news shouldn't be a major issue. It's their personal choice just like we choose science, arts or commerce. Now you would say they are brainwashed by religion but weren't we brainwashed by the society to choose engineering while we either had some other career plans or no career guidance. If these kids are brainwashed to renounce the world, even we are brainwashed to gain academic success, a high paying job, a good looking wife, cute children, huge house, luxurious cars and foreign travels thinking that they might bring happiness to us. But in reality we exhaust ourselves as we run behind the materialistic world. Great logic guys.

949,Food,"Try the recipies in the 'one pot one shot recepie book', which can be found at r/indianFood wiki. [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/indianfood/wiki/resources) I'm gonna try to keep this post as short as possible coz a rice cooker is a pretty versatile cooking utensil and you can cook a wide variety of dishes with a little bit of imagination. 

1. Bagara Rice - Basically, rice with all the household spices, onions and chillies. Vegetables are optional. Heat oil directly into the cooker base, roast cloves, cinnamon, Shahjeera, bay leaf, garlic, slit chillies, thinly sliced onions, ginger and ginger garlic paste till the you no longer get the raw smell. Can also add veggies like carrot, potatoes, capsicum and frozen peas. I also add kasuri methi and pepper to the mix for some flavour. Finally, add washed rice to the mix and stir for a couple of minutes. Since you said its a rice cooker, I assume it's an electric one so just cook till it switches to keep warm mode. Also, add water and salt to the mix after you add the rice. I generally buy packets containing a mix of almost all the spices at the local kirana store. The whole thing takes me about half an hour at most. You can also ghee/butter for some added flavour.

2. Pongal - Another rice dish, again, south Indian. You need moong dal for this one. Roast some jeera, red chillies, ginger, green chillies, and black pepper in the base. Tastes better if you roast them in ghee but you can make do with oil. Now add the moong dal and rice to the mix. It's generally a 1-2 ratio in the same order. Add water, salt and some turmeric powder and you are done with the process.  Can also add some coconut shavings to the mix if you wanna put in a little bit of effort. 

The only issue I used to face with a rice cooker was the I had to hold down the cooking button initially coz it was a weight based system. The oil wouldn't heat up coz the switch would revert to keep warm mode unless held down. You might have to do that initially too. I don't know where you are from but in the south, we generally make a lot of veggie fries and these are pretty easy to make in a rice cooker too. You don't need to add a lot of seasoning either, just salt, turmeric and red chilli powder should suffice. Hope I helped buddy, good luck.

I wonder if someone can sue them for lying because i doubt you can literally get rid of 100% of micro-organisms A similar debate existed in New York among some Jewish groups when it was found that NYC tap water contained microscopic shrimp. 

[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/nyregion/the-waters-fine-but-is-it-kosher.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/nyregion/the-waters-fine-but-is-it-kosher.html) Even if you kill the bacteria, their leftover bodies are still in the water. How do you explain removing all of that?

And just by the way, once it's out, there's a myriad of all the new bacteria that will again enter the water. Technically, you cannot get rid of it. By that logic, each creature on Earth is non-vegetarian.

Vegetarian water. Thanks, enough of Internet for today. This was worse than those tv ads that claim to reduce fat putting your legs on that leg shaking machine. So basically before the advent of these machines everyone was a non vegetarian including Rishis Munis etc. who drank directly from the source. Interesting, so basically dahi/curd/yougurt should be non vegetarian according to these peeps This is stupid on so many levels.
The best way to achieve what they are claiming is by getting distilled water and keeping them in sterilised containers.

Also there are microbes in the air, and many normal microbial flora on the skin and in the mouth not to mention the intestine. If you go by that logic everyone is a non vegetarian. What logic. Will staunch vegetarians filter out chicken from butter chicken and eat the gravy? Going by this logic, then at a microscopic level every type food we eat is non-vegetarian like vegetables, fruits, nuts, etc. Prestige should immediately release pressure cookers that removes these microorganisms from food as well. lmao What home water filtration system will use chemicals?  In the US, the standard setups are:

1)  Water softener + reverse osmosis or

2)  Active carbon filter

Neither is intended to kill micro-organisms, both are intended to filter the water, with slightly different effects.

A water softener *might* kill some micro-organisms, but I think that's a bit dubious.  In any case, the RO should filter out their poor little dead bodies...

Who has a chlorine system in the home drinking water?  I know it exists for pools, but no one should be regularly drinking pool water. This is a gravity filter. These guys should be taken to court for advertisements like these. Because there is no regulation (or rather lack of implementation) people put out ads like this. Majority of the population falls for these. I think this is Nithyanandas brand Science: Am I joke to you? Now Patanjali will use this idea to sell water.

Pani piyo gau mutra mila kr. Sirf ₹50/L Tell me, would you rather drink hard tap water or pure distilled water ?? It also removes all of the mineral in the water, good luck drinking that shit. Do people realise that since their body is meat, they are technically non vegetarian? 100% PURE VEGETARIAN .. Is there such a thing as impure vegetarian? Aren't bacteria prokaryotes, thereby not animals? Apne ko non veg pani hi suit karta IMA has not endorsed this yet? My family and i are ok with non-veg water. Can unicellular organisms and especially viruses be classified as animals? Only in India. religions It says ""no chemicals"" below the veggie claim.

More to this the air we breathe also have germs.

The intestine does contain germs.

The Yakult, Curd, Yogurt all are germ containing food which are good for health. Reminds me of a restaurant in Pune called Surve's Pure Non-veg which is just next to a ""Pure"" Veg restaurant.

The CS rep on chat was refunding 30 bucks for an item worth 80 bucks. Raised the same issue on twitter and got my hard earned money back. Link the screenshot just for reference.

Swiggy customer service is deteriorating and CS reps seem to be powerless in front of the automated refund system. Honestly, fuck Swiggy and whoever approved their refund policies.  
  
Once I ordered a Chicken Burger Meal worth ₹270 and only got Fries and Drink, no burger. As a grand token of apology, Swiggy offered me a whopping ₹50 coupon for a burger that was atleast ₹160.  
I simply uninstalled it right there, even though I've a annual super plan. Now my monthly food expenses of ~6k goes through Zomato/Uber Eats.  
  
Issmein tera ghata, mera kuch nahi jata. Happened to me with Zomato using the WC coupon for cashback. ""It's a technical glitch, you can order again and the coupon will work"" I use zomato and get better discounts. Zomato compensates even if the delivery is late but sadly they don't have something like Super in swiggy Tweet at swiggycares . They will definitely give you a refund. hmmmmmmmmmmmmm Sorry to inform you but you have Ebola

OP - Hmmm Swiggys CC sucks. Ordered pizza worth Rs. 382, the deliver boy messed up and all the toppings and cheese was off, right at the house gate clicked pictures and started chat. After half an hour of wait the customer rep replies with the same bullshit. Swiggy is shady is fuck in this things..


 Also one more thing check out the price of an item while ordering with them and the same item price on the menu of the restaurant.. Its usually 20 to 30 bucks higher on Swiggy..

956,Food,"It's true - I just recently discovered short grain Ambur biryani and it has actually changed my life in a small way. 

IMO Basmati is actually a very boring rice and doesn't soak up the biryani masala properly. Fun fact: there's a spicy variety of rice named Kalanamak grown in Piprahwa (UP).

Bonus fun fact: If you get a chance to go there, make sure to visit the Piprahwa stupa, among the oldest in the world, and also the site from where the Buddha's bodily remains were excavated (and later gifted to the Thai royalty by the British to earn their goodwill). India has forgotten its varied variety of grains, India is also forgetting its varied variety of Bananas (North India has forgotten them). There are many indigenous foods India has forgotten or in the process of forgetting them. Rice and millet varieties are astounding. And delicious. I have zero clue why shops import and restaurants use so much quinoa from S America when foxtail is just as delicious and accomplishes the same thing from a culinary perspective. This was very informative. Thanks for posting Well be slave to mnc seed companies and follow IPR dictated by US.

It works but it’s not magic and takes time and patience to lose weight. Pictures you see on the web sometimes are misleading that people can shed 10kg in a month or something like that but that’s extremely hard.

I have done IF and the hunger pangs are so hard to control initially. Once the water content in the body drops in the first 2 weeks, you will start seeing changes.

I like how people here are saying that higher education in India is shit, meanwhile completely ignoring the elephant in the room which is oversupply of graduates in comparison to existing industries and jobs.   
  
EDIT: Lots of comment under my comment saying there is no oversupply, but rather undersupply of good engineers etc. From my experience, a lot of entry level position in mechanical/chemical/metallurgy don't expect much from the graduates, and you mostly learn on the job. Those are the positions I am referring to. Not referring to IT/programming jobs out there. In coding type of jobs, it is well understood that you need to learn things yourself. No matter if you are from M(assachusetts)IT or M(adhav)IT. And if you are telling me that there is an oversupply of non-coding jobs in India, then give me a break. I understand you found this peculiar but you need to understand how the how world works mate. Its okay to do any kind of a job. This is life. If someone makes their ends meet through irregular but perfectly legal jobs so let it be. We play with the cards we are dealt with. No point in looking at others cards amrite?  In my honest opinion, Nothing wrong in doing petty works to earn some extra cash. We Indians need to stop judging someone by his occupation. 

This article is best example, sorry for pep talk but, Your past means nothing if you work hard for your future. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/billionaires-who-came-from-nothing-2013-12 MTech in India is useless unless you do from a old IIT (D/B/M/K) - even there HR prefer B.Tech students over MTech. Well a job is a job. What is the purpose of education if you think someone is big or small for a job. 
Only thing that matters is can you do justice to a job. 

 In India people think too much about doing petty jobs while in US it's fairly normal thing.  ""here I am janitor, in Russia I am physicist"" Degrees can give you an entry but it's your skill that decides your future.

Edit: added a word Thanks for the 5 star rating sir. Very obliged to keep up the streak.  He had a higher degree -- but going by your replies to comments on this post, looks like you had very little *education.* You ignorant little boy. Are you sure that you have received any education? It doesn't seem so from your post. I disagree with the comments that if you are an engineer from non  premier colleges, you are fucked.

 It's a knowledge based economy and if you have technical skills,  along with passable social skills, companies will chase after you. In the era of edx and Coursera, you have free access to the best professors and no one can blame their colleges for not doing well in life. I know guys, very ordinary guys, who went to unheard of colleges and are now at Google and Amazon. They just kept learning after graduating.

It's sad to hear such cases nonetheless, and wish more guys tried harder before giving up. A job is a job. I know some people who are delivery boys because they like riding. Dignity of labor  Dignity of labour not a thing anymore? He's earning himself and probably don't rely on his parents/might even be supporting them. Obviously down to earth guy/hardworking. Guy is better than half of Indian population.  Tfw when a company hires you as Dev ops, but assigns you to delivery duty to experience the problems first hand/s Just like Phds and ceos drove uber initially. Things will settle soon like the cab market after all the image boost and these people with bikes are gonna get 10-15k for the full time. Recently had an epiphany that we are a bunch of educated judgemental people!! So, whom are we blaming our judgemental skills on this time, family? society or the education system itself? Well education is a bit of a ponzi scheme. An education doesn’t imply financial success or even sustainence. It’s a myth that is sold for the employers benefit. A surplus workforce is great for the employers but not for employees I shouldnt name names.

But hiring process in Indoa is shambolic. I applied to a comapny called fiserv last year in March through there job portal for multiple roles.


Just getting regection mails now almost after a year.


And I am literally like- Am I a joke to you? If anyone is looking forward to apply there please refrain from doing so.
 It's the quality of the degree that matters. Most indian graduates learn nothing from third class education, can't blame the job market alone. May be he is just doing part time or may be he just wants to make some extra money on the top of what he is already making while you are relaxing on your couch and ordering food and loosing money lol [removed] There are many shitty colleges in India. Just because you have a degree doesn't means that you are educated. probably too late to the thread but here goes...

OPS doesn't seem to be *mocking* the delivery guy. rather - it seems he's ***stunned*** by the fact the Delivery Guy is doing this despite having a respectable degree.
 He could be like, nope I want to do MBA now, Mtech won't my cup of tea.  
So he didn't take any other job, joined swiggy, while he prepares for cat.  
He earns his pocket money, doesn't have gap year (looks good on resume), studies hard and becomes cxo of swiggy/Zomato in the coming years. [deleted] My question is, why is it important to know so many details about the guy delivering my food. We need to tip them regardless of all details. In today's world as always its about who you know, not what you know. A guy with higher degree than me? Most of our politicians say the same kind of thing. Welcome to dignity of labor.  This thread is more depressing than an episode of black mirror. Why are you doing this guys. Do you even know how hard it is to find a good job. We need to pay bills when we are in searching for jobs. I think delivery job is very best job because we can do when ever we want and get a decent amount of money to pay bills. 
I think Indians need to grow up from this judgemental mentality. what's the problem?

We don't know him. His financial condition or for whatever reason he is delivering food ( since I see an inherent bias in the question that delivering food is a lowly job which is fucking ridiculous )

get on with your lives people.  I hope we soon stop relating educational qualification of people with the work they do to earn for themselves. What app is this? Good observation though! We are engineers lol How is the jobs? Why does that company need to provide this information in the first place ? Cant judge someone on the basis of their work. They might under transformation or planning ahead for something in future. The problem with indians is we start ranking jobs as menial and respectful. A guy with a higher degree than you can also do your taxes, argue in court for you, manage your wealth, fix your body up, etc.

What's wrong with delivering food? Why they are showing his educational background? I mean I never seen on my app anything like that? Which delivery app is this? He could just be doing it part time until he gets a real job  Why don't anyone blame Zomato for exposing one's personal information in order to make people give out tips? We don't even know whether the whole tipped amount goes to the delivery guy without any ""convenience charges""!

Think this practice of giving out ""extra"" details than name and number to customer should be discouraged. We are nobody to judge anyone.
 I remember the 2005 - 2010 period where a lot of engineering colleges capitalized on the dreams of the people and made a hell lot of money. Ads used to be all over the place with placements and it was the chaar log who used to idolize engineering in such a way that the population was brainwashed collectively to believe that life would be set after engineering.

This thread is so depressing. I'm sure nobody would tackle the creamy layer i.e, college owners who sit on a heap of cash crashing the dreams of the oppressed.

I know it hard to see and live like this but with huge population you need to mark something/ somewhere in life to earn and live The problem is that India churns out a lot of low quality graduates, I know a lot of companies desperate to hire good workers, but the talent pool isn't good enough to hire. There are also a lot of demand for skilled technicians like electrician, plumber etc. But because it is a status issue in India no one wants to do that kind of work. We need more people in ITIs and polytechnics *chuckles*

 This is just mean on Zomatos part.  Does anyone else feel like it's weird that people are posting these ""oh look at how highly educated the guy that's delivering my food is"" stories? The comments are always the same whether they're sympathizing with the person for having to do what they consider a demeaning and ill paying job or using it to debate the status of education and employment in India they're still making a lot of assumptions about someone about whom they know next to nothing. I dunno it makes me feel uncomfortable.  Good that he is working instead of complaining.  TBH, I think there is no shame in doing any work. I guess everyone goes through this phase of being the delivery man in life. i have been one on many occasions and hated all of them. I sorted by controversial to see a shitshow and all the most downvoted comments are literally just OP playing a fool by lashing out at people. OP if you see this take a deep breath and step back for a bit don't get so emotionally invested in an internet discussion it's bad for you.  Increasing unemployment in India 😪 What is the point of your education when you are going to be so judgmental? 
This is the double standard of Indians. We'll go abroad and do odd jobs but no one can do it here. We'll dissect it to shreds. Guys like this are delivering food, or selling pakodas and illiterate goon Neta's running our nation. I know plenty of our people who graduated without being able to code if their life depended on it... Don't assume that they have skills just because they are engg graduates Well there's a good chance that this is his part time job, right? We shouldn't judge based on one sided story. Only place in the world where parents force you to study something you don’t like and they’ll happily let you live under their roof to show you off as an engineer rather than face reality and accept that they created this failure for you I swear anytime I see an Indian nationalist flaunting how we have the most numbers of engineers in the world I’m showing him this. We need to remember it’s about quality not quantity Big deal maybe he's trying for UPSC may be this is his part time job. I would not be surprised if a lot of guys with degrees are out-earned by people without them, in the coming years or decades.

&#x200B;

Employment opportunities are very less.  That is why we are welcoming more international companies to establish their work in India so that this will generate more employment. Why is this a big deal? The fact that it is demonstrates how incredibly fucked up the class divide is here in India. Like holy shit, most suburban college students elsewhere like in the U.S. work summer jobs like bartending, waitressing, driving a Uber (sometimes even working multiple jobs), after graduation and even in between semesters (some even do during college season) to pay off their rent or student loan debts

Also the premise that everybody seems to be hopping on is that the guy is somehow going to end up delivering Chicken Biryanis for life and that must be immediately directly correlated to the education system. It could very well be him trying to earn a bit of money on the side instead of sitting idly while looking for jobs 

Even if that were true, which it almost certainly isn't, people here should be lambasting the government's failure to generate employment and implement vocational training programmes, not lambasting the fucking education system

Oh us bourgeois cunts here on Reddit I tell you All the big brain doofuses that are writing and upvoting stupid shit like ""Oh the standard of engineering professionals in India is pretty poor"", do you think the guy/gal that topped this dude's class or even a plurality of the people in his class are also delivering Chicken Biryanis as well?

If not, doesn't that directly negate your assertion that it has to do with our bad education system and not the failure to generate employment and implementing vocational training programmes by the govt for instance or other plausible, non-systemic reasons such as him simply wanting to make a bit of money on the side whilst applying for jobs?

I don't even get why you lot are adding a negative connotation to the idea of somebody having to deliver food, like Jesus Christ, lots of college students elsewhere in other countries work jobs like this. In fact such jobs are exclusively meant to be done by college students in countries like Denmark I see a lot of comments saying work ethics, surplus graduates etc..but are we not ignoring the reality here ? There is nothing wrong about dreaming for a settled perfect life and they are serious about it and hence they go for higher education. Unemployment rates in India is shooting up , that's of  no doubt..and it's not something that could be solved if we turn our face against it.  Well, an undergrad from an IIT/NIT is worth more than MTech, MS and PhD combined from BichuPichuKuchu Institute of Technology.

You need to adapt and find fun.

I am 38 years now. It is difficult to answer such questions because what a person wants, their cultural orientation, their economic status, their stage in life, feedback from their immediate family and friends, what they think is a good life, etc. vary greatly. 

There are 20 such knobs and you can get to any answer you want by tuning them and you could end up with both great and poor results in either country.

Any internet forum is not a great source of such inputs since you have no idea who is giving them. You might agree with what someone is saying but if you meet them in person you might throw out everything they mentioned.

A better model is to talk to people you have met so you can do a diff between their choice vs. yours and arrive at a qualified input.

What you don't want is a 13 year old giving you advice on how bringing his wife and kids back home was the most difficult thing he has ever done. I grew up in the US, moved back to India in my late teens, and then moved right back to the US. 

My parents moved back for good. So did a cousin of mine. She grew up in the US and then lived in Oz, came back to the US, met an Indian guy who was working in the US, and then moved to India with him. She loves it back in India. And I have a couple of friends who moved back as well.

In my view, it depends on how you identify yourself. I see myself as culturally an American of Indian origin, so I really struggled back in India. My friends who had grown up in India and then went back found it a lot easier. Same with my parents, who had a lot of their friends and family back in India. I also remember standing out a lot because of my accent and my mannerisms (arguably, kids are meaner than adults).

Secondly, things like your career and your aspirations play a role. I honestly have enjoyed the flexibility of jumping around various careers and I don't think that would have been possible in India. My friends who love tech or love finance have done great. I also think India has a ton of great opportunities now and it's a great time to make a difference.

Three, quality of life. It's an interesting mix. If you have a great job and good income, you could live like a king in India. Have someone drive you around, domestic help to cook and clean, much more affordable etc. But on the other hand, everyday Western amenities would be surprisingly hard. Getting anywhere would be hard, driving is nuts, lots of pollution, not exactly clean, and it's hard if you have dietary restrictions. But overall, if you're willing to live in a bubble, it'll be incredible and unparalleled.

Four, are you single or married? Western style dating is hard. A good friend who grew up in India moved back after 15 years. He's really struggling with dating. He's fellow dark South Indian guy and unsurprisingly, he's really struggling to date. On the other hand, I have a friend who's a white woman from Wisconsin and moved to Mumbai and met her French boyfriend there. But I think if you have kids and a family back in India, it's a no-brainer.

Five, if you like activities, it maybe a bit harder in India. There's great stuff for families but if you like to go rock climbing or kayaking or sailing or what have you, it'll be much harder. On the other hand, if you enjoy clothes and jewelry and great Indian food and spending time with friends and family, India would be incredible. 

Finally, food and drink. India is surprisingly conservative when it comes to alcohol. It's really hard to get a good drink with your meal at most places. While India has a lot of great food, and even other cuisines, they all tend to be very Indianized. I have a chili allergy so I can't eat spicy food at all but even oats and Italian food in India are spicy!!! Allergies aren't well respected in general. Salads are not a thing and fake meat isn't common. Even with real meat, getting a good steak or getting bacon is really hard. So if you like traditional Indian food then you'll have a blast. If not, it maybe a bit harder. For me, this was the hardest. I don't eat a lot of carbs or spice and anything with milk gives me the runs. So I found it really hard. After a while of eating all those carbs and curries, I really wanted a fresh salad but even if you made one, getting salad dressings are hard. But I'm sure it's changed these days.

The are probably other reasons as well. At the end of the day, it also comes down to where you're living and whether you think you have the ability to go back if you didn't like India. Having lived and worked around the world now, I much prefer somewhere like Melbourne which has a much higher standard of living. [deleted] How much money you need to survive is all upto your lifestyle.

Before I moved back I didn’t have much cash but had invested in real estate. The rent money kept me afloat till I was able to settle again. Mixed... Except struggle with lack of social circle, most of the things are better. The years in Vaterland. I am also moving back after 9 years. Looking forward for it.

YMMV I suppose. Gulhind here. Girls pay you a lot more attention, guys get jealous af and more malicious, and teachers have preformed ideas about how you secured admission into the college.

Hands down arguably the best places in Europe. They both are absolutely beautiful and worth a trip, out of all the countries I’ve been to in Europe, I find these 2 the most worthwhile. Switzerland is the best. Also you can try Austria . Anyways check the current weather as Europe is facing a very harsh summer now. Avoid Paris and Italy .
Switzerland is expensive by the way . If you are going to Geneva, you can visit Lyon, France just 1.5hr bus/train ride. In my opinion its better than Paris for French culture(Food/stay is cheaper than Paris).
You don't have a very popular Eiffel tower here. But I think its worth if you are nearby.

You can PM me if you want.

It's super hot here now 35C most of France has no AC. Is that the Droid from the new Star Wars movie? Chup kar ke prague chale jao... beer piyo aur chill karo.

Post on the orague sub and meet some local redditers... hit the party scene Food - Italy (my God their tomatoes and Olive oil!)    
Culture - Every country has culture  
Countryside living - Lots of places offer it. French countryside is nice. Southern France especially, lots of Europeans vacation there. Remember Cannes from Mr Bean's Holiday? All that beautiful country side was south-east France.   

I know Indians and Bollywood have a hard on for Switzerland, but I would not recommend staying there. It is a beautiful country that will take your breath away, but it'll burn your pockets at the same time. Smarter thing to do is start camp at a cheaper country like Italy or Spain, take trains or blablacar for day trips (suggesting day trips since your tenure is short) to expensive countries like CH or DE.   

Unless you're hell bent on it, don't waste time in pubs. You'll find pubs anywhere across the world - it's 4 walls with some lights and dhikchak dhikchak. You can pick up girls maybe and find a dulhan (if you're into that sappy eurotrip crap) if you're desperate.    
It's better to spend time/money to experience things that you can only experience there - food, homestays, countryside, vineyards, nude beaches, etc. Do go to bars though, you can meet interesting locals or fellow travellers. 3 guys? I do not know what is your exact preference but I'd ask you to consider Vienna, Budapest, and Prague. Culturally nice, diverse, and great for your pocket too. If you really want more country side maybe add innsbruck/Haltstatt in Austria into the mix.

&#x200B;

The reason why I suggest this, Austria has similar views as Switzerland, Vienna is awesome as a town, Budapest is both pretty and great for party (and 2.5 hours by bus from Vienna). Prague is...just visit it...you wont regret it.

&#x200B;

Also, in Europe most of these towns have night pub crawl walking tours and free walking tours, by companies like sandemann If you choose Switzerland, I have some suggestions that will save you some money. Switzerland is pretty expensive compared to other countries. Book hotels that offer free breakfast take advantage of it. Buy from the hot food bar of the two major grocery stores ""Coop"" and ""Migros"". They are usually 1/3rd of the price of eating in restaurants. 

&#x200B;

Public transportation is phenomenal in Switzerland, They will take you almost anywhere, so stay in places outside of major hubs like Interlaken & Zurich. There is significant difference in hotel prices outside of major tourist places.

&#x200B;

Look into getting a travel pass, there are two kinds, one of which you only pay half fare for any train, bus or boat journeys and another which you pay nothing other than the cost of travel pass. Switzerland, I took a rental car from geneva to zurich and back exploring little villages and towns along the way. You can also drive through the alpine passes(furka pass being a good one) during this time of the year. 3 guys? Bachelors? Apply for a visa before you make any bookings at all. 

Back in 2016, we planned a 2 weeks visit. The four of us, me, my wife and 2 of my bachelor friends, applied for Schnegen visa together. My wife and I got the visa, my friends didn't. Got rejected upon reapplication too. Both have a stable job, family ties to India, the documentation was complete, but they just didn't get the visa. If you're not really into partying and love road trips you can try Iceland. It's really beautiful and you might get to see Northern lights. On a side note, is a 1.5 lakh Europe trip possible if I stay at hostels and stuff? I feel European countries can be sorted by 'gotta see' rating. If you go to Europe and return seeing Lucerne - you sort of have not really experienced Europe per se.

.....Switzerland - Beautiful alps.. and that is sorta where it ends. (Xenophobic Swiss)

&#x200B;

I strongly recommend the top two.  2 days in Paris + 3 days in Rome.

Go to Paris, enjoy the Eiffel tower, the sandwiches, walk along seine, walk on the Champs-Elysees, the Louvre...

Early morning flight to Rome ($50)

Marvel at the chaotic traffic, the old historic architecture mixed with modern malls, the colosseum, the Trevi fountain, real gelato, pizza, sandwiches, Italians who wave their hands all over... the outdoor cafes in the evening, the squares with musicians.. and of course a guided tour of the Vatican ... Postpone the trip to October, go to Germany, attend the Oktoberfest, then head to Amsterdam. italia Oktoberfest in Munich starts late September. If you do that, Austria and Czech republic are pretty close. And Bavarian Alps is breathtakingly beautiful. This really depends a lot on your interests and budget, but my personal recommendation, if you're interested in food and countryside living, I highly recommend Italy. Spend one day in Rome to see some of the usual tourist sites, and then head to the countryside.  

Is it the most famous and most prettiest part of Europe? Probably not (but its still damn pretty). But it sounds like what you're looking for. I'd recommend the Basque Country (Pais Vasco). It's often overlooked by non-European tourists - indeed, you won't find the usual Chinese or American tour group plodding around as you will in the likes of Madrid, Barcelona, Lisboa, Marseille, Roma, Firenze, Munchen etc.

I'm just back from 3.5 days cycling in the region: Biarritz - Hendaye - Donostia - Amorebieta - Gernika - Bermeo - Bilbao - Llodio - Vitoria-Gasteiz - Durango.

The whole area is great for mountain biking and road cycling - lots of hills and some descent col-type descents - particularly just north of Bilbao and south of Durango. The coast from Hendaye down to Donostia hosts a decent number of surfing competitions. The sunset over San Jan de Gaztelugatze is fairly unbeatable too. Regards food, Donostia (also known as ""San Sebastian"") has the *highest* number of Michelin-starred restaurants per capita of any city on the planet (16 at present) - a great mix of seafood as well as produce from the interior. Snacks such as pintxos and txapoli are worth a try in the early evening. Nightlife often continues deep into the early morning (3am+). You'll also notice there's a real hybrid of cultures - Basque mixed with French and Spanish influences. Street signs are often bi- (if not trilingual) and there's a decent number of art museums across the region too (the most famous being the Guggenheim and Bellas Artes in Bilbao). Once you go out of the main towns you'll often see many signs advocating for independence for Euskara (the Basque region). If you're cycling it's also relatively easy to stick your bike on the trains (Euskotren, Cercanias, TER, though possibly you might need a reservation with Renfe). I stayed in some top-quality Airbnbs (5\* superhosts) and spent less than €85 all-in for 3 nights in 3 separate cities (Anglet, Bilbao, Vitoria-Gasteiz), and this is pretty close to peak-season.

&#x200B;

Regards some of the other suggestions on the thread: Amsterdam (having lived there) is a *massive* tourist trap (in the ""grachtengordel"" - i.e. the canal region). The accommodation is massively overpriced. The only Airbnbs are quite a way out from the centre. The quality of food and drink outside supermarkets is very poor given what you are being charged. The place attracts some of the most clueless tourists from outside Europe - really, if they want drugs and hookers there are plenty of other cities which offer similar and much more affordable prices - just that those tourists generally haven't heard of them. Dutch cuisine is considered some of the most unappetizing food on the continent - take a random city in say, Finland and then compare the number of clients a Greek restaurant receives compared to say a Dutch one, and you'll see my point. And as for the landscape - it's pretty flat and boring, since much of the land has been reclaimed from the sea (in the case of Flevoland, barely a century ago). Switzerland is a bit more interesting as a quadrilingual country, particularly with regards to the landscape - but again, it's massively overpriced and you might as well head over to the Dolomiti (Italian Alps), Julianski (Slovenian Alps) or even Franche-Comte for better value. I would not recommend going to Europe. Why spend your money in a place that is increasingly nationalistic and racist. Keep it in Asia.

I normally offer water to everyone and tip 40 or above (these guys earn 40/delivery), tipping makes a huge difference for them, plus it gives you this Serotonin high, win-win if you ask me. :)  


Specially make sure you offer something to your local postman, cycle pe delivery karte hain, plus sab 40+ hote hain. Bhai giving cold good quality water is good enough.

Cold drink : if you mean soft drinks like coca cola, seriously don't do it. They are working for food industry ffs. Offering them sugar water or random quality/temperature water and wasting their time is illogical, they can carry their own safe water bottle in that 100 water bottle carrying capacity bag. They are getting paid decent money for the work or you can just give them a smile, rate high stars and tip them in money instead of doing this cringy shit.

Nice suggestion though, I will try to have buttermilk prepared and chilled for them in future. This is elitist ideology. A lot of people can't afford to. Save that money everytime you order and put it in a FD. Will they stop eating our food then? Well whenever the delivery guys comes at my door I make sure I ask him if he needs water.

I used to be so scared of having tea after fish pakora. I am eating chicken as normal. Nothing bad as happened till now. Buy from a retail shop that keeps meat frozen from the beginning, or if you have a proper butcher buy freshly cut chicken. might be a good idea to avoid steam momos type dishes. but properly cooked chicken should be fine. eating out is always going to have its risks. i have had food poisoning at restaurants that are very popular so there was little chance of having stale food. these days i mostly order from a local restaurant owned by a guy who i have came to know personally because of frequent ordering. i have been to the kitchen. have seen their deep freezer. has been working fine so far! The issues are that you are eating outside food, where people cut corners to make a profit. You never know what they are serving & would be wise to stay away in the rainy season. There are more chances of getting food sickness in Monsoon, but if cooked well, and at home; you should be fine. The chances of microbes and diseases speading is high during the monsoon, also after the first wave of the monsoon season many chicken die while being transported, your maa is kinda right. Yes it is very humid during monsoons Someone from med background here. 

First of all,  it is true that monsoons does have higher rate of infection.  This is simply because moisture and ambient temperature ( 30-40)  are good source for organisms to grow which can range from bacteria,  fungi etc.  After heating as well,  some microorganisms may survive.  

BUT!! 

It doesn't mean you will necessarily get the infection lol.  It depends on the place itself.  Unhygienic place with dirty water,  no sanitation will lead to higher chances of infection no matter what the season is.  So like any intelligent non vegetarian,  don't eat those 30rs chicken stuff.  Not good. 

Chicken( or any non veg) from a hygienic restaurant is completely fine.  Again also depends on your immunity in case you do eat a wrong meat.  So yeah,  spend it well if you want to eat it. 

Your mom pretty much is basing her opinion by thinking all restaurant have filthy areas for preparation of chicken.  Which is not true obviously. Honestly, it's generally a bad idea to eat meat in India during summers, especially from small shops/restaurants that don't always have proper refrigeration. Meat spoils quickly in this heat. Throw in power cuts and it's a recipe for getting food poisoning They are called *old wives tales* for a reason. They are *old*, as in not relevant in the modern age with more advanced technology, they are from *wives* as in housewives who are not exactly known for conducting scientific research on these topics, and *tales* as in just a bunch of stories or myths. Since no one here mentioned  colistin

It is used to fatten up chicken Mostly in India and China.

 it's an antibiotic of last resort and may cause antibiotic resistance I just wanna tell you the type of microorganism you congest while eating dead flesh, that makes you sick, so eating meat in any season isn't good.

I myself have done over 100 shoots personally .. leaving Hyatt regency in Lucknow, I've not seen a single restaurant who would nof do such gross shit, that made me give up on eating outside or even ordering. Now coming to your question of cloud kitchen.. these are a cocktail of poor hygiene with bad economic choices .. basically these people are lured into to by let's say a thousand views or visits to their restaurant on the app in exchange of a sum of money .. sales managers get monthly target, these sales managers have a specific area in a city .. and they literally just fool owners about these ""hits""  .. these assholes would do anything to match with their targets and get incentives..  now if you just open a restaurant in an app, and then go back, it counts as a hit. More over 'allegedly', swiggy has guys back in Bangalore to complete these hit targets .. and thus little to no revenue comes out of these investments .. hence this creates a vicious cycle where only customer has to lose.. they will cut down to shitty oil, low quality or dead meat, etc...

I have seen shit fall onto the ground, and then they packed it up and served to a customer later on .. one cloud kitchen in gorakhpur, had literally a toilet seat in the kitchen .. when a shoot takes place, 15 to 25 items are shot .. these are then kept indefinitely until an order comes and they heat it back again and dispatch .. my personal advice, never order online from anywhere via anything .. only outlet who are genuine with their quality are domino's and other multinational chains who have to live up to the reputation.

These cloud kitchens have absolutely no accountability.. when confronted, they'll show the fassai licence which can be obtained how? You may well guess. The majority of restaurants listed on swiggy are not cloud kitchens. A few seconds of research is enough to find out whether they have a dine-in option or not. Not ordering from places you've never been is completely pointless. >I've actually decided to stop ordering from places I haven't been to personally.

That's what I do.

I do check zomato for restaurant photos.

I ordered from a cloud kitchen once. Didn't like the food at all. Hence stopped ordering from cloud kitchens. i used to order a lot from freshmenu which i guess is a good example of a cloud kitchen? it was great in early days. later it was shit. i guess they grew too fast and compromised on quality. in the end, i stopped ordering online. 

now i order from a local kitchen only outlet where i have seen the kitchen, met the cooks. most of the time i do take out so i actually get the food prepared in front of my eyes. in the end, labels do not really matter. kitchens which only do take-outs or home delivery get a lot of flexibility as they do not have to spend resources on waiters and of course the dining area and such. this local guy decided to not have seating because it would have compromised rest of the operation. he is running indian, chinese and bakery from his establishment. tons of space for the cooks and baker. kitchen is accessible to you if you do take out and want a tour. friendly owners. 

it all depends upon the operator. you find a few good places. you stick with them. and you move out if they become shit. 

a restaurant does not guarantee a clean hygienic kitchen. unless it is an open kitchen which you can see from the dining area. eating out would always have the risk of food contamination. find a local small business catering to your requirement. ask them for a tour of the kitchen. and support them if they deliver on your expectations! I once ordered from a place called Midnight pizza and food, that shit was nasty as fuck. They are also huge contributors to your neighbourhood garbage dump Wholeheartedly agree.. I am never satisfied whenever I order in.. restaurants can get away with a lot of things.. things that would never be acceptable in a dine in situation.. I have received undercooked food, stale food, parathas with soil in them (literally!) and so on.. the irony is- whenever I order I want my food as soon as possible.. but my. Heart sinks after seeing the piping hot curries in flimsy plastic boxes.. some dishes are just not meant for ordering.. There’s no joy anymore in eating a special dish..  at least we had the consolation of ordering tried and tasted dishes from trusted restaurants.. this cloud thing will take away that one thing too.. there’s no accountability here.. reviews are losing their impact due to fake ones. I frequently order from a cloud kitchen, food tastes great, packaging is good. Never had any issues. I don't get food from anywhere where I can't see the food being made. Cloud kitchens are governed by the same rules that govern regular restaurants. They have to procure the same licenses, have to undergo the same kind of audits, etc. Besides, it's not just Swiggy or Zomato that have cloud kitchens. 

Cloud kitchens are a business by itself and there are a lot of third party businesses,including the likes of Future Group (that own Big Bazaar) that have their own cloud kitchens.

These kitchens are as clean (or as unclean) as any other restaurant. 

In any case, how many times do you check out the kitchen of a restaurant when you dine in? In all likelihood you could be eating at places with great ambience and a dead lizard in the kitchen. How can you be sure? so looks like a food with great taste can be sold on cloud kitchen. is it hard to make such food? ",1562860178.0,1,25,0,51,"So, recently my Dad told me that a lot of the restaurants on Swiggy are actually part of Swiggy's 'Cloud Kitchen' system wherein, the restaurants aren't actually dine-in places and are maintained entirely by Swiggy. It also turns out that lot of these ""cloud kitchens"" aren't really maintained all that well and because they don't have a dine-in option, you don't really know how the quality control is.

This seems like a really bad idea and I've actually decided to stop ordering from places I haven't been to personally.

I usually order something from swiggy but it's getting too expensive. Last month I spent around 10k on food which I ordered from outside. I think it's high time I learn to cook my own food now as it's also affecting my health. Can you suggest some easy to cook meals for one? I'm looking for suggestions on what I could eat for breakfast that are easy to make and require least amount of time and cheap. I have the utensils , an induction cooker and a microwave. Please advice in detail.",[NP] Advice on easy to cook food.
978,Food,"Not sure if you know this, but there is this technique called OPOS: One Pot One Shot. It take more time for my mom to cut vegetables than to cook it. North Indian sabjis are cooked in 10 mins or so and South Indian ones in 5. Super fast and easy IMO. 

It has a bit of a learning curve but even I started learning from her because cooking has become ridiculously easy now. I'm able to cook roti, 2 sabjis, dal, chawal in like 30 mins maybe. 

If you want to learn, join the groups ""OPOS School"" and ""OPOS Support Group"" on Facebook (I cant include facebook links in the comment). They have around 1 lakh members and are pretty responsive when you need help. 

A couple of good blogs in this field: 

* [The Millet Table](https://www.millettable.com) : Focuses mainly on healthy recipes using OPOS and Millets

* [Anyone Can Koch](https://anyonecankoch.wordpress.com) : General OPOS recipes. 

Trust me, it has a steep learning curve, but it has changed my life. Everyone in my family uses OPOS now to cook.

Example Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhyHLzteQXQ Start off with eggs. Pretty much everything is easy and you can google whatever kind of eggs you like.

If you want to make proper meals, it's best to get lots of tupperware boxes, make prepared meals and freeze them, since you have all the stuff you need anyway. This is what I did in college:

* Take chicken breasts(4-6 boobs) and dice them into pieces

* Pan fry some chopped onions in oil with salt and garlic till they're mildly golden/soft

* Add the chicken to the mix and add more oil. Just enough to make the surface wet and so that nothing sticks on the pan.

* Once the chicken is golden brown, take a bite with a fork to see if its okay

* Add about 4-5 chopped tomatoes(finely) to the mix. Squish them a bit to release the water. The tomatoes should make the whole mixture more wet

* After the tomatoes have been squshied, and the broth feels consistent, add masalas or toppings that you like. I prefer garam masala, peas, capsicum, red chilli powder, but you can also go with mango achaar(tastes brilliant), green chillies, bell peppers, curd(not too much). See what condiments are missing and experiment and be creative. Add a bit of soya if you like.

* Once everything is done, it'll look like a hot mess. Let it cool a bit and put all of the food in the tupperware boxes. This should be enough for 3-4 meals. 

* Keep the boxes in the freezer. You can take it out, and microwave the food whenever you want. They stay okay for 2 weeks. You can have it with frozen rotis from metro or bread.

All of this would help you save a lot of cash

_____________

TIP: If youre worried that the tomatoes might lose water when you chop them, or that they're too fucking squishy, boil them first. They would expand and break through the skin, which you can peel off and you'll hold a solid tomato kind of like an orange. You can chop that very easily and that blends quickly into the mixture too.

PM me if you're confused about any of this, or want to know other stuff that you can make. Have fun! Sandwiches with bread. You can put various things in it like different sliced meats, omelette, salade, anything you want. Here are some simple breakfast recipes. Buy your favorite bread to accompany it:

1. Eggs: Fry em or boil em, good start to the day. Easiest to make.

2. Green Chutney: Buy Coriander Leaves previous night and use grated coconut. Throw in Coriander, Coconut, one garlic clove, chilli (if you like) and salt into a blender. Tasty chutney is ready in 15 minutes. Needs to be stored in the fridge if you want to have it later. NOTE: About coconuts, grate the entire shell and store in the fridge close to the freezer. Will last for days. Do not leave it out. Throw it away if it starts to smell sour.

Dinner suggestion:

I usually have rice with any curry so I have a dedicated electric rice cooker. Its a fucking breeze.  Just add 1 cup rice, 2 cups water (same rule applies for more quantities, water=2x quantity of rice). Fill it shut it and forget it (after pressing the cook button of-course).

If you aren't a rice guy, buy readymade chapatis that need to be heated on tawa. Saves a ton of time. Also, get yourself a decent pressure cooker. It's a lifesaver.

For example, let's look at 15 minute toor dal:

\- Cut 1 onion diced. 1 chilli and 1 garlic clove. Get curry-patta if you can.

Cooking is as simple as:

	\- Oil in pressure cooker. Wait till hot.

	\- Throw in the cut chilli and garlic, wait a minute, then add curry patta

	\- Throw in the onions, wait for them to be translucent

	\- Throw in soaked dal

	\- Add water. Typically 2-3x amount of dal

	\- Add salt. Close pressure cooker and wait for 1-2 whistles.

	\- Turn off, let it rest and enjoy

Dal would take you 30 mins max including the time to cut the veggies.

Hope this helps. Cooking for yourself is the healthiest, and most cost effective way to feed yourself. All the best! Maybe [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnHxGBnLP5w) can help. The fastest thing you can make is egg bhurji. It does not take more than ten minutes and you can have it with bread. Don't bother with roti even though sabjis take little time to make. It's not easy to master and the flour makes a huge mess. 
Daal and rice, egg/mushroom fried rice/noodles, stir fried veggies are easy to make too. 

Buy peeled garlic cause it's annoying to peel it by yourself.

Salami/tuna sandwiches with pickle, butter, cheese and tandoori mayo taste good too and it only takes 2-3 mins to make it. 
Macaroni is also quick and white sauce can be made in literally two mins. Fry garlic in butter, add one tablespoon of flour, stir quickly, pour 100ml milk and one slice of cheese, oregano/chilli flakes and it's done. You just gotta toss the boiled macaroni in the sauce. Poha, Upma, Rice, Dal is easy to make! To begin with 

Boil noodles (not maggi) or pasta and add a curry on top.

Put mixed veggies, spices and washed rice into a bowl and pour water to the level of the rice and cook till water is evaporated and you got pulav.  Eat it with pickle or yogurt.


Buy some minced meat, sauté it with some spices, onion and any veggies, mix it with mayonnaise and use it as a spread for sandwich.

979,Food,"Poverty doesn't grant a great lifestyle. You forget that we have a very bad hospital to population ratio. 

When there aren't enough hospitals the available ones will be crowded I think it’s a combination of air pollution, mental stress and poor dietary habits.
Kids and elders have it even worse because of lower immunity:( Pollution.  
Some 14 or 15 of the top 20 most polluted cities in the world are in India, and most of them from the north. Poor hygiene, allergens, pollution, like so many reasons! >The hall was crowded with so many sad faces

I would be sad too if I was sick and in a hospital Also a lot of young people, including I myself, wear glasses. And I don't think it is just north India; it looks like a pan-india phenomen. For instance, in Kerala, healthcare, especially in the private sector, is a thriving business and there is no dearth of patients in the near foreseeable future. Certain disease causing micro-organisms are active in Tropical climate like ours.

Too much crowding makes India's population (especially urban) ripe for contagious diseases. Living in North India there are plenty of reasons I can think so first of all , adulterated food , even fruits and vegetables have lost their previous taste and have more and more been grown with harmful pesticides and insecticides ... 

Second, would be the people's mindset , oh you got a cold ? Just lay in bed for a few days you will get better ! 
Accha 1 hafta ho gya bimaar hote hote? Le haldi Wala dudh pile ! 

This really happens 

Following this many people take harmful Indian remedies instead of just visiting a doctor. 

3rd , air pollution as you know , it causes asthma and various other lung related diseases , I myself got bronchitis as a child 

4th open gutters , lack of hygiene in some parts . 

Feel free to add on Our jobs are way too stressful.

Our lives are invested beyond sense into constantly gathering stuff for social status.

Our diet does not really change as per the seasons. It is very unhealthy.

And lastly, we are a very insecure country. Our governance, national infrastructure, business houses, jobs, education, medicine, etc. does not really give you any comfort.

This has had a very negative effect on our collective psyche, which is percolating throughout the country. 

The entire country is like an organism, which is getting more and more rotten from within. 1. Living conditions. India is a backward country. Open sewers, unfinished construction, all kinds of shit on roads, no serious regulations on food, air pollution etc. 
2. Terrible nutrition. High in carbohydrates and fats (roti, rice and ghee/oil) and extremely low in protein (the major source is dal which is always a side).
3. Lack of exercise. What is the life of an average Indian? Eat, job, sleep, repeat; and most middle class men work clerical jobs so there's not much activity. While it could be true, You are making a gross generalization of event you witnessed which wouldn't even necessarily imply what you are understanding by it bro You just have a weak immunity, or may be you had too many antibiotics in your childhood! I am from Himachal, last time i got sick was in 2015, The butter and cream I have always thought that this can be traced back to British rule in India. I could be grossly wrong, but a lot of our ancestors in those days were starved, dehydrated, etc, and those poor genes have been passed down to us over time leading to poor immunity Over reliance on medication since childhood for silly things like cold, fever, cough, ulcers.. things that a healthy immune system is more than capable of solving on its own. People eat medicines line candy and hence they never let the immune system develop.

The immune system becomes stronger over time by learning from its previous encounters with bacteria, etc and keeps correcting itself and improvises over the course of your life. We are suppressing the growth of our immune if we take hard medication and don't let it do is job. It simply never is able to learn.

Also we have terrible food and diet. Just eat simple cooked vegetables, dal, protein, etc. The obscene amount of sugar we intake is scary. I hate the new generation, we simply moved away from bars to these unhealthy fancy milkshakes and desert places. Pretty sure that obscene amount of sugar harms you a lot more than what two beers over a weekend would.

The food outside is a joke. Too much junk, too much sugar and very little nutritional value. Even at home we do the same. Parathas, gulab jamuns, etc. That's not good. Also obesity doubly slams your immunity as it's causes of plenty more problems.

Immunity is not that difficult. Eat healthy, eat simple (boiled, cooked in good healthy oils, eat proteins like soya, egg) and stop eating random non veg food. The way the chickens are grown it's not healthy anymore. Avoid chicken unless you can find some desi ass kala murga, not those fat obese ones with broken legs pumped with steroids to grow.

Also fuck this obsession with milk. You don't need milk in everything. Some things like paneer, curd are healthy but milk in itself is intended for a calf or newborn. There isn't much there for a fully grown adult.

Good doet, lesser pills, more fruits and vegetables (preferably boiled) and enough protein is plenty too keep your immunity in check.

I haven't eaten a pill in 4+ years and never gotten sick beyond the simple cold once a year or so and gone within a week. Perfectly healthy and no tummy. It's not that difficult really.

Please don't confuse this for anti vaccination. Please give your kids all the vaccination. They need it for a healthy future. But stop eating Crocin for a fever is my point. Fever hapoens because your immune system raises temperature to create an inhospitable environment for the intruders, bacteria, etc. While the higher temperatures might feel uncomfortable, they are your immune response to the threat. It's not wise to suppress it needlessly.

Same with cold, we get cough because our immunity cells and bacteria are dying trying to fight each other in a full fledged war and the cough is one way to dispose their bodies and also to create an inhospitable environment for them. Again, while uncomfortable it's your body's natural immune response and is a good sign.

Just let the immune system do it's goddamn job, lol. It tries, it usually wins and it learns from its previous encounters. Of course that's grossly oversimplifying things but our body is designed pretty well for most common problems. Don't let these money digging profit minded pharma people trick you into thinking otherwise. No, you don't need 20+ medicines for that cold. Rest and drink water and you'll be fine.

Ever wondered why Homeopathy is so popular even when it's a sham? Because it enforce strict rules which contribute to your building your immunity and the medicines are of course just water diluted in more water, lol. People who claim homeopathy worked for them don't realise that it's their immunity doing it all along. It becomes a problem when they take homeopathic treatment for things which are serious and should be cured with traditional medication as science found. Are you saying that hospitals in other parts of the country are largely empty or something? No idea why you make that assumption lol. Bullshit Our weakened immunity; Reasons being our over dependence of Pills and Tablets, fucks-up the immunity... 

Eating carbs is harmful, but thats partially true, Simple vs. Complex carbs... Our meal traditionally gives us lots of Complex Carbs, for protein vegetarians do lack certain great sources, but Pulses pound for pound are the best protein sources, when eaten with grains; they complement each other and complete the amino acid profile.

Now for Fats, certain fats are great, most of them what we eat readily are the bad ones... Momos accompanied with Mayo... Just see what Mayo is made up of... And the rampant Egg Butter main Sandwiches and such alarming quantities of so called butter, thats actually Margarine basically spreadable Vegetable oil butter... Sells for 100Rs. A kilo... clogs up arteries ...

Moderation is key... We came well off from the deadly diseases that wreaked havoc on or forefathers... But along the way we created our on diseases. Most Indians lack Vitamin D, and that's in a tropical country such as ours... 

We eat almost 10-12 teaspoons of sugar daily... Think of eating a whole sugarcane with your own teeth and feel the pain.

Seasonal Fruits that are supposed to be eaten once or twice a week, we eat almost everyday... 

Give your body a chance to repair itself... it is a complex machinery that can have certain tolerances...

Traditionally few or our food habits were excellent... Use of turmeric, peppers, cumin, tamarind, western countries are researching them and we are forgetting what our forefathers gave us. Germs can travel easy and mutate easy among so many people. It is the product of our population and bad sanitation. High population, low amount of doctors and hospitals, poor waste collection and disposal, pollution It's the water I bet. And bad hygiene. Stop eating carbs. 40% of your bodily problems will disappear in itself. Filth mostly. Poor sanitation, open sewers, open garbage dumps, too many people so communicable diseases spread quickly, antibiotic resistant bacteria ",1555635907.0,0,44,0,355,,Spotted a refrigerator in Hyderabad where you can keep the food for those in need.

That is not our culture.

Those these days many owners include it in bill under 'Service Charge' and many people tip as it is a new trend in Indian society.

But mostly it is no. 10 or 20 depending the overall bill. And only if service charge is not imposed. I pay service charge. 80% of the time, there is service charge atleast added to the bill. So I don't tip extra.

Takeaways I don't tip. And most fast food prepaid places I don't tip.

I tip my waiter everyone we go to a local bars. The alcohol and food is cheap and the waiter are chilled out guys. Or in some places where I felt the waiter has actually done something extra. 

I am against automatic tipping. This has never been a culture while growing and I am not used to it. Already included in the bill as “service charge” or something. 10 Rs if the bill is more than 100Rs

Else it can go upto 40Rs depending on how classier it gets.

Also, if its high end pub, I have put in 50 to 100rs.

Edit : All this, only if no service charge is included. No Most places include atleast 5% service charge, why is there is a need to tip again? Tip tip barsa paani... If you are at expensive place, read the check/bill and see if it mentions CGST and SGST. If it does then that's it, you don't need to pay anything.

If you are at small restaurant serving coffee and snacks,  anything upto Rs.20 is fine. Depends. If they do a good job, then I tip them 40/50 bucks. 10 if it’s just satisfactory. No tip if they don’t care.

And another goes for delivery. RIP their backs. There should be a day in the year where we celebrate the efforts of these delivery people in our lives. They have become a very integral part of our lives in the last few years. The thing I most hate about this is how overqualified most of these people are for these jobs.
I recently was assigned to a delivery guy, who was an M.Com graduate and spoke 4 languages. Yet here he was delivering me Pav Bhaji and Thumsup. What's the delivery company in the fourth pic? what they need is a union. They are heros. Their efficiency is unbelievable Glad human beings are being employed, 15 years from now delivery will be done Robot / drones Why is anyone surprised by this? Most major metros have had a tiffin culture for decades. I used to work in Gurgaon (Delhi) and almost everyone had their lunch delivered. Now its just corporate and mobile apps instead of one company supplying a whole street/colony via phone calls. And then there are Captain Americas ... those delivery guys carrying DTH dish antennas. do you guys tip these delivery guys? i know people who order a little extra food to share with their drivers. i just give them ₹20-₹30. even then some drivers turn down the tips. 

a tip here or there doesn't make a huge difference, but if more people start tipping our delivery drivers it'd go a long way to show them our appreciation for having to deal with all the hassle that we outsource to them and so don't have to deal with anymore. Why doesn't anyone design a two wheeler that cater only to delivery guys?

I noticed that when I order from zomato and my friend orders something too from the same restaurant. We get 2 delivery guys coming to our location from the same restaurant. Why isn't there an algorithm made that merges the orders from one restaurant to one location to a single delivery boy. This causes unnecessary traffic and congestion. Also waste of fuel These delivery bikes need to be regulated somehow.
they have no road or driving etiquettes they creat an absolutely nuisance in traffic 
there’s been a huge influx of them causing a strain on the city’s roads, we’re not equipped to deal with such a large number of bikes on the roads. They don't deliver to me. Am I in the ^bad list? One other way to look at it is our developing economy and increasing labour jobs. Do anyone have the habit of tipping those guys?. Is it okay to give them a tip or ₹10 or is it unnecessary. They are everywhere these days because they get a decent amount for doing that. So many of them won't work for it if it wasn't paying them a good wedge. I am sure they earn about 30-40. one of the employees from these companies would be able to go more in the economics of these deals. So Santa Claus is everywhere? This os ehat employment looks like Blue-collar jobs are now mostly red colored. Don't mock them. They are just jobless graduates. Many of them have high degrees like BE or MBA.

986,Food,"Zomato Takes a percentage cut from the price of every order they provide to the restaurant. These Handling Charges are consumed only by the restaurant and Zomato gets Zero cut from this specific charge. 

Let's see

You order two items of Rs100 from Zomato 50x2=100

Handling Charges Rs10 per item         10x2=20

Taxes on the items not on handling charges 5%= 5

Delivery Charge Rs 20

&#x200B;

You paid 100+20+5+20= 145

Zomato usually takes 18% flat if they offer delivery and 10% if the order is fulfilled by the restaurant.

Zomato took 18% from the base price i.e Rs 18

So the restaurant receives 145-5-20-18=102

The restaurant has to recover the cost somehow and Zomato encourages this style because win-win for Zomato and Restaurant

Honestly, Discounts are designed to drive more orders and you almost never get a good deal. You are still spending money after a discount in fact more because the discount made you purchase the item in the first place. I don't think that this is coming from Zomato, I think that this is a Burger King charge. I just checked swiggy and it's the same there, there is an extra RS. 29 restaurant charge, and that's dispite the fact that I'm a Swiggy Super member. Swiggy..Zomato..food panda...all same shit.

Just today I found a home delivery place with a nice variety and 0 delivery charge or minimum order within 2km

If we can figure out a way to give all local business this kind of power...all food ordering would be screwed.

If any body wants to collab on such a project ...pm me I never bothered with these apps. Restaurants near our home deliver free over a certain price point. Need to recuperate those costs from all those expensive advertising campaigns lol I always knew this was gonna turn into some kind of a scam since they had this 40% offer thing going on for months together and that got me thinking. The way they are making people outsource cooking food, is gonna hurt Indians in long run. Food is dirt cheap in India if you've habit of cooking your own food. But once you start ordering food from outside on regular basis, i think it's hard to hold on to your habit of cooking. What is Chicken Whooper?  probably their way of punishing you for ordering chicken on a tuesday It may be an unpopular opinion:

Fact: Handling charges go to the Restaurant not to Zomato. 

Opinion: You are absolutely more than welcome to drive in the Heat and save that amount! 
And next time, please tip those guys, they work in pathetic conditions. Zomato or swiggy prices are higher, if you go to restaurant and check menu and still they add handling charges And also if you notice ,the prices of items are slightly higher in Zomato than in restaurants. Bookmyshow also doing that with convenience charge Dont order from Zomato. Use swiggy and get super membership. Seems bit better. r/assholedesign There is no such thing as discount.

987,Food,"Its a catch 22 situation. 

While other vendors are giving below par quality (sometimes harmful) meals to children - these people are giving good quality (because of their beliefs) but not including onions and garlic. 

Can we not have some ethical agencies which does both?

> When asked if the government was being partial to APF, Umashankar denied it. “Who is going to serve such a huge number of children if we cancel this contract?” he said. “There are logistical issues; overnight, we cannot build kitchens and hire cooks. The administration cannot function on the basis of philosophical arguments. I’ve told these activists directly — they have their heads in the clouds. I live on earth.”

If you ignore his tone here - he has a valid point. The only reason APF keeps getting contract is because they are performing well and meeting the scale. > In February 2019, NIN gave its formal nod to APF’s menu and said: “The nutritive values of menus with ingredients used in the mentioned amounts certainly meet and often exceed the prescribed energy (Kcal) and protein requirements prescribed by MHRD (Ministry of Human Resource Development) for the MDM.”

Seems like right nutritional value is met... If kids prefer meat, they could skip this meal as they do, according to the article My wedding was in a ISKCON TEMPLE.yes. ironic that I'm an athiest. But I take don't know why they don't like onion and garlic

Also their food was really good. Didn't realise that it was without onion & garlic It is what it is... APF is giving high quality food at reasonable cost with some restrictions. Onion and garlic are great but flavor can be achieved without them and iskcon Cooks do that. Seems like much Ado about nothing

I'm willing to bet that if there was another org that was serving food with meat and eggs and all that, there would have been voices saying that there's no options for vegetarians

It is difficult to reach a large scale when you try to accommodate everyone's preferences Atleast it is better quality than what they would be getting out of government run kitchens.

Is the government even prepared to provide food to so many childrens while maintaining the same standards.The answer is NO. Time for a Tadka service. An NGO that just provides onion and garlic tadka to this food and we are set. Let Iskon give their food (as they are cheap & efficient) - because that is all the state can afford.

People who are complaining can just deliver supplements to the form of beef, onion, pork etc. I have couple of questions 


Does the food have all the nutritional value recommended? 

Does the food taste good??

Is it hygienic and of good quality?

Is this the cheapest bid?

If answers to all of the above questions are yes , then I dont see any problem My question is off topic, but what happened to the people who served poisonous mid-day meal in bihar some time back? Jees what a bunch of ungrateful kids. They get really good food, fresh and nutritious food. But do these kids want to spoil  themselves. Today its onion tomorrow they may say add maggie and burgers. What's the problem with onion and garlic? Anybody can explain? It's not like they are feeding meat to vegetarians. Onion and garlic have lots of  benefits. Why would one single out two vegetables out of children's diet citing stupid reasons. Which idiot approved of this. About time children's diet at government schools should be written by dieticians and nutrition experts and not some idiot in a company who doesn't know shit about nutrition.  Some religions have traditions where they don't allow people to eat any crop that grows underground like potato/onion because it kills insects & microorganisms when they are uprooted. Doesn't every crop kills them because most of plants that grow outside are also uprooted once they are reaped? Before going into the taste of food which is quite subjective people don't realise that the places where mid day meals schemes are operated are some of the poorest regions in India. Think about it for a second, why do they need food to lure kids into these schools? I agree it should taste good too but what people don't realise is how bad food provided to these can be without regulations. 

In my state a few years ago there were multiple reports of lizards, cockroaches being found in food. Kids were admitted to hospitals coz of food poisoning. In some instances the cooks had to make do with as less as half the ration because rest was unusable. I have seen kids who had to drink just the rice water with salt and eat the rice for lunch. And they did that because that was the only meal they could get. 

APF provides food in many states of the country. I'm no fan of isckon and have heard worse things from friends and family who used to once blindly follow them without realising the amount of brainwashing they do. But sadly, they're providing these meals that are cost effective, on a large scale, cooked according to standards and nutritious value. I would been more than happy if we could have accomodated all kinds of food to suit the children's palate but we need to look at ground realities first. The food is provided free of cost coz of poverty. Unless that is tackled nothing much is going to change. APF should be thrown out. Onion, garlic, eggs and meat should be part of the children's diet. 80 percent of Karnataka has no  issues with a non vegetarian diet. Isn't this a case of minority appeasement?And this minority very likely doesn't attend the schools where mid day meals are served. Yet they decide what everyone else gets to eat. So in our desire to please imaginary gods we will keep those unhappy who are right here on earth and as close to innocence as possible (or anyone for that matter). Bhagwan ko prasad chadhayo bachche jayen bhaad mein. 

Jo sattvicta ka dhol peetthe hain vo hi zyada tamasic hote hain on imposing their choices on others. A nonvegetarian will not force others to eat non-veg, but a vegetarian sure will. What happens when religion mixes with poverty.
If Christians or Muslims enforce a diet, will India keep quiet? First, it is Hindi imposition and now they want to push their bland vegetarian food onto the Shudras and Dalits. There will be a violent reaction if BJP plays with language and food culture down south. We are a non vegetarian people. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/eggs-on-mdm-platter-of-two-lakh-kids-in-odisha/articleshow/67505876.cms To anyone complaining about the absence of eggs in Akshaya Patra meals. 

""However, in November 2018, the NGO agreed to pay for the eggs instead of cooking it in its three central kitchens that serves food in 1980 schools across the state. (Orissa)

“We got many requests from parents to serve eggs in the MDM. Since the NGO did not agree we come out with an agreement that the NGO will not supply boiled eggs to schools directly, instead the school managements will provide the boiled eggs and Akshaya Patra will bear the cost,” said nodal officer of MDM, Gangadhar Sahoo.""

To me, it just appears to be that these people are completely dedicated to feeding children, aur kaanda lasoon nahi khaaya toh kya bigad gayaa? Can any health and nutrition expert explain to me what one misses out on when they don't consume Onions and Garlic?? Why give Contract to these ISKCON chutiyas in the first place! If you don't see a problem APF deciding the menu, think a Christian missionary or Muslim org coming up as a vendor with their own very tasty and nutritious menu. After all, kids are made vegetarians by their parents, they will not have any problem eating rich proteins at school.

988,Food,"Going to Mumbai in a few days, will update. Been in Delhi all my life. I dread the first three changes. Bang on about all points. This comes from a Delhite settled in Mumbai for 15 years Mumbai is way more safer for girls. In mumbai you’ll see girls wearing mini skirts entering into kaali peeli taxis alone at 1:00 am at night. Not sure if Delhi girls can do that. Also cat calling in much more common in Delhi than Mumbai. One Important question. How the food? Street Food what would you choose Mumbai or Delhi? You're right about most of it. Move a few kilometers into Haryana however, and you'll be in a Gangs of Wasseypur type of situation.
About the roads, their quality near the parliament area makes me think of Isle of Man TT style road races happening on them whenever I'm travelling there. Pollution. Delhi is a toxic gas chamber And most of the Delhi guys aren't aware who their father is - the most common dialogue - ""Tu jaanta hai mera baap kaun hai?"" 

How the hell would I know! 🤣 “If” my impressions** (typo in title) Delhi is very green, especially south delhi. There are park after park in Saket and Hauz Khas. 

The amount of history everywhere is also surprising. Like in the middle of a residential area in Mehrauli, you'll have a 400 year old monument

Houses in Delhi are also so much bigger. My 2 bedroom house is literally twice the size of my brother's 2 bedroom house in Mumbai

I'm not the biggest fan of Delhi, but if you discount the pollution, Delhi is easily the most livable of all the major metros. Bangalore is way too tiny for its population, Mumbai is too cramped, and Kolkata is just too filthy and poor (no idea about Chennai since I've never been there) Are Bombay people kinder than Delhi people??? You came from an organically evolved city to a top-down constructed one. While you get all the benefits of infrastructure, you will find the quality of people is bad and there is no harmony among them. This post reminds me of Abhishek Upmanyu's Bombay-Delhi jokes. Love that guy. \- I won't be too hasty about point #5, I'll conceded that traffic cops are more strict in Mumbai but otherwise there is little to differentiate between the two.

\- Bang on about autos in Delhi, they'll never run by the meter. It's better to take an Uber.

\- You hadn't mentioned so let me add, unless you are a hardcore seafood addict, Delhi food scene is far far ahead of any other metro. Right from street food to fine dining. I rule out Delhi as a good place to live in because of two factors

1. Unsafe for women

2. Almost unbreathable during winter

Otherwise, I love Delhi's food and metro. These are two areas where Delhi does better than every other city in India. All true. You scored 100/100 People in Delhi take things for granted. I recently was coming back from Mussoorie. The roads are very narrow. So there can only be two lines for vehicles , one for going uphill and one for going downhill. The lane for traffic going up is always busy as you reach near  Mussoorie. But this one guy broke his lane from way back and got stuck in front of our bus which was going downhill  and instead of making way for the bus he started arguing with the local who tried solve the situation. The car had a  number plate of Delhi.
 
The bus driver literally said this thing"" abe hatao isko... pata nhi kaha se aa jaate hai ye delhi waale saari road to inke baap ki hai"". As a delhi-ite here who's been living in Mumbai for the past 7 years,it is like going to wasseypur when I visit family back home now i am from mumbai and now in delhi ,

in total standard of living and ease of living in bad (not me but gov statics) Mumbai anytime 😁🤘 There's no comparison between Mumbai locals and Delhi metro. While locals are the lifeline of Mumbai, they're just too old, too unsafe, and too crowded. They cannot be called a modern public transportation network. That said, Mumbai has gone in overdrive in metro construction in last few years. In here before everyone starts saying *women can't go out at X hour of night* without living here.

Ola/Uber Share/Pool cost same or even lesser than autos so we all travel by **cabs** and even Micro  cab rides are not that costly. Hahahah. On point, all of those. Bombay people = way more grounded and less snobbish than Delhi. Delhi = aggressive, hostile. Bombay = sorry boss, move on. Delhi metro is miles ahead of Bombay local trains.

 Apparently, education is too expensive and teachers don't get paid enough. The sad, pathetic reality is this Indeed job app This is a wrong comparison. Delivery guys risk their lives on the road fighting pollution, heat and traffic and what not. Also, they get this much salary by doing overtime shifts. Even though primary school teachers are the guiding light for future leaders, even though i know they are underpaid, comparison is wrong. 

A well educated and skilled school teacher can still get a good salary at the end of the month, there are so many opportunities right now, work from home, and all. But yeah a single source of income is not enough and they will end up working more and exhausting themselves if they serve multiple platforms. पकौड़े छानो। I guess the monetary value of any job is based on its demand in the market,

Delivering door to door under hot sun, with unbearable traffic, is hardwork, i doubt many people would want to do it.

If you're looking at Yoga, Goa has retreats but is a party destination as well. Purple Valley is a good place. Goa is also close to Mysore which is another center for yoga in the world, particularly Ashtanga. Goa is also close to Hampi which is basically ruins of an ancient temple city - you'll find lots of fellow yoga enthusiasts there too!

I don't have much idea about the quality of yoga retreats and courses in Rishikesh but it will be much cooler and closer to nature. Being in the mountain helps. Also, finding non vegetarian food in Rishikesh is going to be very tough.

Tuk tuks (called auto rickshaws here) will try to fleece you. Insist on going by meter if there's no other choice.

Goa and Rishikesh both have good hostel scenes. Check out Zostel (a chain of hostels) or any decently rated hostel on booking.com should be fine.


Be prepared for people staring at you - some might even come up and ask for selfies. Uber For Travelling, stay in good hotels and Goa it is. If you are on a trip to devbhoomi, don't forget to visit the Queen of Hills, mussorie. Less hot and humid(Rishikesh is fairly hot even in monsoons).Being a Canadian, Mussorie should suit you better. dude, thats like 2/3rds of all Canadians, who will run things around here? August - September is a monsoon time in India. Late September there'll be less frequent rains.

For beaches, Goa definitely is the way to go. There are a lot of old temples in South India, however not many close to Goa. Closest that I can think of are Gokarna, Hampi (Hindu temple ruins), Ajanta and Ellora caves (no temples per se, but ancient caves with Hindu and Buddhist religious imagery). However each of these places will be around nearly 10 hrs journey by road or rail. 

Rishikesh will be a very different story. There are lots of fun stuff to do like rafting, but you need to check if it's open in rains. I doubt it. Weather will be a bit cold, cloudy and wet. There's a lot of places to visit nearby. Mussoorie and Dehradun are pretty close. Nainital is around 4-5 hours away. And it's all hills. Pretty good place to relax as well. >Goa or Rishikesh?

Rishikesh has more yoga camps and you’ll find more yoga enthusiasts there.

If it rains there(not sure about the forecasts) during that time all the water adventure sports will be closed.

There are yoga camps in Goa but it’s more for partying and enjoying beaches rather than Yoga.

Prefer uber or ola instead of tuk tuk so that you don't have to do unnecessary bargains. In places where there is no cab availability you can use tuk tuk or you can rent a scooter to roam around .

Handle it properly, with smile and show your discomfort when so many ask you.

MP in neither LS nor RS. how ministry ? Missing rajyawardhan rathore as sports minister Jaishankar was a big surprise. Amit Shah has handled Home during Gujarat govt so this was kind of expected. Genuine Question: What is hype around Rajnath Singh? Why is he such a big leader? Can anyone highlight his previous 5 years as the home minister? What are his key contributions to the nation?

I don't have much trust in him as a DM. Why is there no mention of Suresh Prabhu? His omission is big. Having personally worked with his office, he is approachable, humble, hardworking and an intelligent man. 

The Shiv Sena angle is also good, politically speaking.

r/savedyouaclick Nothing is native to any place with everything has been originated someplace else. It's what they (the natives) make it out that's important. Indians developed those ingredients as their own and what came out was an utterly delicious extravaganza. There is simply no alternative to it in the World of food. Well it made Europeans to come here and take all of it. Yes Chilies came from South America to most of India, but I suspect they are also native to the North East and Indo-China - more research is needed - the idea that all capsicum came from the Americas is the generally accepted theory but indigenous varieties pop up all the time in the wild. Really nice article. Thanks for sharing it. I had my first ""Shradhaa"" last year due to my grandmother passing away. Eventhough it was a poignant occasion, the food was very memorable. Many of these dishes that are described in the article were made, and it was an interesting and flavourful experience. It would be pretty cool if the cuisine was made popular outside these occasions because I think they deserve it. It was initially hard for me to imagine food without the non-native ingredients, but the meal was really delicious.

1008,Food,"Maylar is actually safe for food storage. So, no worries.

This is from University of California:
""PET or PETE (Polyethylene terephthalate) laminate pouches are excellent food containers. PETE is a food-grade plastic with no known toxicities. Sometimes they are referred to as “mylar bags”. This type of foil dramatically reduces the transmission of oxygen and moisture through the film. To store DRY food, use oxygen absorbers and a vacuum heat seal."" 
(site: http://ucanr.edu/blogs/blogcore/postdetail.cfm?postnum=18457) Yes its totally safe.  Its like tetra packaging but only thin.  It has 2 plastic layers and a aluminium layer in between Not every packet is safe only the good and reputed  restaurants are investing in packaging of food otherwise small ones are just using packs made from cheaper materials available at lower cost in market. i doubt this is mylar. just silver coloured plastic bags.  It is only the outside of the bag which has a metallic look. The inner side is white and *looks like* plastic and, *to my untrained eyes, appears to be worse* than the thicker grade transparent plastic bags they used to send food in before the plastic ban.

The ones that we get here in Pune, look like [this](https://www.amazon.in/Aluminium-Multipurpose-Packaging-Available-Quantities/dp/B07P2ND7DS). Click on the third picture to see the inside of the bag.

I have the exact same concern as the OP each time I order food. End result, I order from outside much lesser lately. It is very harmful to health - try to avoid these toxic silver coloured mylar lookalikes. I am poor but somebody give this guy a gold. This deserves it. I believe its a type of aluminium foil... It is aluminium foil. Many of the restaurants have started to use this after the recent plastic ban enforced by the govt. 

It is safe and similar to using a foil container or foil sheet to wrap the food. 

If restaurants go for other modes of packaging then it sometimes end up costing more than the food price itself.

[The Millet Table](https://www.millettable.com)

[Anyone Can Kock](https://anyonecankoch.wordpress.com) Relatives all have cooks or maids that help with prep. Cooking daily fresh Indian food is a full time job. I stay at home, OH works and we have a 2 year old. We don't have any help as we are outside India but we do share the house load (OH and I both cook dinner which I then have for lunch and I make veg parathas for the little one as he prefers rotis over rice and I get to sneak in veggies). Our fare is mostly South Indian and it is freshly made every day (except for the leftovers that I have for lunch). Our breakfast is always oatmeal as it's the easiest. Dinner is usually chicken with sometimes a veg curry/daal. OH also makes fish/pork curries for himself as well. The one thing that saves me a lot of time is the chapatis - I buy them instead of making them as they turn out hard on an induction hob (parathas are softer as they are mixed with mashed veggies). We also make biryani very regularly which doesn't take long at all. We have limited options to prepare as a lot of veggies/ingredients aren't available here but it works for us. We steer clear of time consuming dishes like dosa, poori etc (which needs chutney, bhaji, sambar) and these are made very rarely. Little ones are notorious for being picky eaters so I make sure we have at least few items he eats at all times like eggs, sausages, yogurt. The veg parathas are very easy to make as i just mix the mashed veggies with the flour and knead and roll out parathas immediately. We do not freeze or pre cut anything as it's not something I like to do but maybe that works for you. It's quite doable as long as you don't have expectations of cooking multiple items for each meal. Khichdi / Pongal - fill cooker with equal parts rice and (moong) dal, (some cut veggies), some jeera, pepper, chillies, (turmeric), salt, seasoning.  Steam.

It doesn't take more than 20 minutes to chop and mix. Another 20 to cook. I learnt about 5 Southern Indian dishes when I was there. In my case since I'm just cooking for myself it's easy, I'd say each dish can last me about 4-5 meals, and I usually have 2 prepared together. That means I only cook once every 3 days. Having larger vessels will help you here, though you're probably again limited by the size of your fridge - I live with 3 other people so only have access to 1/4 to 1/3 of my fridge/freezer.

I cook Moroccan, Italian, and some (adulterated) Chinese food but focusing on the southern Indian dishes the ones I do are:

\*orange/brown lentils with tomatoes, coriander

\*spiced potatoes with cauliflower and beans

\*palak paneer with ginger/garlic

\*semolina ""uppitu""

\*Alappuzha prawn curry with coconut milk

In the case of the first and fifth ones you have to either let things soak overnight or defrost, but in total my cooking time for all these is *never* more than 50 mins.
